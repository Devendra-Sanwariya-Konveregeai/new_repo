The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family).

Garrelts", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Expensive and Somewhat Limited Format", "unixReviewTime": 1381968000, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2013"}

The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A nice book.", "unixReviewTime": 1360022400, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2013"}

But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear \"BPA free\" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?

We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month).

The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that's it!  Drop and flip!  No twisting, shoving or cutting like the Genie.  And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it can't be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it's easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well (unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans)!Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no \"blades\" involved.  I just didn't like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery.  The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening!  This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.

However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem:  SmellAnswer:  Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags, and it does keep the smell out. After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing, when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it. Empty the champ at least twice a week, if not more. We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we don't empty it out on a regular basis.If you don't want to spend the money on the diaper champ, try a regular diaper pail with a lid. You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out(plus regulare maintance), and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper:Safety 1st Diaper Pail: 8 gallons it's  a bit small$9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail: 13 gallons bags @ Target $16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail: 8 gallons $14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I can't honestly review them. These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative. I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars. It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor, no expensive refills. Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use. The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle.

This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tricks to the Champ...", "unixReviewTime": 1133913600, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2005"}

Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).

I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.' In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week. For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!! Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two. SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful. Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "ignore bad reviews, grate product, no smells here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1123891200, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2005"}

The first time I tried to put in on the mattress, I was fussing and swearing at it and was sweating my butt off trying to get it hooked on. It is not intuitive at all to snap on:1) The snap bands aren't placed equidistant so you just have to guess at where they should go.2) In order to snap the opposite side you have to lean over and INTO the crib (or you have to pull it away from the wall)...3) All while trying to stick your fingers through the slats to pull the bands through and snap them.4) Once I had the bands hooked where it seemed they should...I got to the opposite end and there was NO WAY the bands were hooking--it was a few inches too short! GRRRRRRR!At that point, sweaty and frustrated, I gave up and threw the damn thing at my husband and told him to do it. Since then, I've had to do it myself, and I still hate it although I am getting better.The pros?It is nicely waterproof. When the boy spits up or his diaper leaks or he sweats a lot, it does not make it through to the mattress. But that said, it's not like there's a lot of liquid to worry about.We haven't had any issue with the snaps not staying snapped or the baby getting underneath the sheet.Overall?We are still using this, although I am not quite sure why.

I received it at my baby shower, but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our 11 month old daughter.  I am glad we only have one of these!The Ultimate Crib Sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner, one fully-removable elastic strap in the center of the short end, and two straps on each long end.  We have a Pali Wendy 4-in-1 Convertible Crib and the corner posts are quite thick, to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners.  Instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there's slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath.  Since our daughter is a \"perimeter\" sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib, that is a problem.The majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed. It would be easy for Summer Infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable.  This sheet fits better on a standard/traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts.I also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs.  We have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between 1-8 months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep - she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result.  On the handful of occasions where she's thrown up in her crib (always when she's come down with an upper respiratory bug), she's inevitably hosed the bumper as well.  In those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is of little real utility for us.I could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies/toddlers who often have various \"accidents\" in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly.

However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot.  There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate.  Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it!  The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous.  Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib.  I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore.  But, there is an upside.  This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use.  Snap, snap--that's it.  There is no lifting the mattress.  And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress.  Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere.  To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress.

Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms.

The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly, it is also easy to put  together. But it has two big minuses:1. Its height. The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs, so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not. It barely fits under our chest.2. THE REAL ISSUE: The width of the slot through which the cables come out. MY TODDLER's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly, so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord. What is the point of this item? We just hope, at this point, that it will be a further discouragement--and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest, we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in. Hopefully we'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers. Although the toddler will be able to reach in, he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell. This, of course, would not stop him/her from turning the switch off--in our case, this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed, among other bothers.In summary: buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall.

This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to \"plug\" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.

Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations.  So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install.  Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets.  Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into.  They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest.  I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS:  The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket.  Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS:  Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit.  But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids.  And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors.  However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS:  Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight).  So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel.

The plug has a little rim around it that sits up. I'm sure this helps prevent leaks, but it also prevents all water from adequately draining out. I have to turn the tub completely upside-down to ensure that all water has drained. The more I think about it, the more I think I'd like to try a different tub.

It isn't a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn't sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device.

It's designed to be reconfigurable for a given area, so that the enclosure can be made to fit odd spaces. It works for indoor and outdoor areas, and the optional extensions can be used to make rather large enclosures quite easily.We bought this as a replacement for the Pack-N-Play type portable play yard. Our son, at 10 months or so, had clearly outgrown this smaller type yard, and was quite unhappy at the limiting horizons of its opaque blue walls. The SuperYard has been a very good, albeit not completely perfect, solution for providing some portable play space that requires somewhat lighter supervision than a freeplay in an open room. Our son's now closing in on 14 months and this has been useful for that purpose.It's not 100% easy to set up and reconfigure, and there's a reason for that. The extra difficulty with piecing the \"end\" sections together means it's nearly impossible for a tot to open or close this by their lonesomes. It takes some strength and adult wile to open the sections and bend the connectors at various angles to thus reconfigure the overall shape. There's a slight trick to negotiating the opening mechanism in a panel, but once you \"get it\", it's easy enough. I suspect many of the comments about difficulty of set-up were written by those who had just set the thing up for the first time or who don't move it around a lot and who have forgotten \"the trick\". We're on our fourth month of using ours, and it's very easy now to open and close the corral, as we call it (perhaps in part because we do it frequently).One of the big advantages of this type of arrangement is the shape of the enclosure can be changed. I think some of the comments about this being unstable are either from those who are unrealistically expecting a completely rigid structure, or those who may have assembled it in a way that the shape is unstable. If you put a 120 degree angle at each of \"joints\" and form at least a hexagon (with the basic model) or an octagon (with the model plus one extension), you get an incredibly stable structure. I can demonstrate this by putting my full 200+ lb weight on the edge when it's open, in which case there's considerable flex, versus when it's closed in an octagon shape, in which case it barely gives and I can practically do a push-up on it.Of course the whole thing can slide -- it's made out of plastic and it's not attached to anything! Your little bruiser may be able to push it around a bit, but your average baby isn't going to get very far. If the structure is set up in a way that it's got some sort of limiter (a wall, for instance) keeping it from moving too far, this really ought not be a problem. The idea is for creating a play yard you can set up easily an in a variety of places, and anything that's fixed permanently is not going to serve that purpose. That's your trade-off with this type of yard versus a smaller crib or similar yard.The expectation for this should be as a semi-temporary safe play area. I would recommend it for creating a \"safe\" play zone in an otherwise unsafe area -- an unchild-proofed room or outside (where we use it from time to time). It is not to create an undersupervised area, except perhaps for  a quick deposit of your tot while you go to the bathroom or answer the door, etcetera.  We use this in the room that has our computer -- despite our attempts to childproof this area, it's pretty impossible given the requirements of computer cabling. The SuperYard has at least made a part of this room safe enough.As for being able to climb over it -- there may be some prodigious children who can scale this using the lattice work as foot-rests, but I strongly suspect they can scale other things as well. Our little guy can pull up on the frame, and it occasionally slips a few inches, but I don't know a lot of toddlers coordinated enough to know how to climb a fence AND who have small enough feet to use the rather small lattice openings. (If you want to be extra sure, just put the kid in some shoes, which will make it impossible to use his toes to grab the lattice holes.)I do recommend getting at least one extension, as the extra two panels nearly double the available surface area options, and if you don't need them you can literally just fold them over without having to detach them.The portability has been excellent -- once you get the knack of how much pressure you need to collapse the sections, it folds up like an accordion, and there's a carrying strap that doubles as a restraining strap to keep the folds together while under transport. Folded up, it takes up about as much space as the smaller Pack N Play but at about half the weight.Where this has been less than ideal has more to do with our kid than the product. He doesn't like being left alone in it, but neither does he like being left alone in any of his other confinements (e.g. crib). The fact that he can see out the SuperYard is a big help; with the old Graco PackNPlay, the opaque sides meant he couldn't see a parent even if quite close. So while he objects to being set down alone, a little distraction with a forgotten toy and the reassurance of being able to see the parent through the \"wall\" usually suffices to make us both happy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good Within its Limitations", "unixReviewTime": 1111104000, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2005"}

If you want to use the Superyard as an extensive gate to block entranceways this gate is fantastic in every way. If you are buying to use as a Playyard, then buy the Playzone if you have an extra fifty bucks.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I wish I had bought the Playzone", "unixReviewTime": 1149897600, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2006"}

My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.

{"reviewerID": "A2AOMAVLH5KAEW", "asin": "B00004TFLB", "reviewerName": "K. Barnett", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewText": "There are really mixed reviews for this product, and I think this is for two reasons: 1) the fact that different people are looking to this product with very different ideas of what they think their kids will get out of it and 2) the fact that the product quality really did go downhill when Munchkin took over from Embryonics.  Let me try to help you sort out both points.Before I do, I should mention that I originally got the Munchkin version, didn't like it, and ended up replacing it with the original Embryonics version, which I like much better.  My 19-month-old seemed to enjoy both versions.Before you get this product, ask yourself, \"What value do I think it will have for my child?\"  Here are a few possibilities:1) You just want some kind of musical toy with which the child can interact to change the song that's playing.  If this is your thought, you will probably be happy with either version of this toy.  (Then again, if that's ALL you want, you'd probably be just as happy with theBaby Einstein Take Along Tunestoy, which my son enjoys, and which is both cheaper and more portable.)2) You want a musical toy that's a bit more interactive, where the child can change the sound of the song that's on.  In this case, you'd also probably be happy with either version of this toy.  My 19-month-old son loves to press the buttons to turn on and off different instruments, change the song playing, and just listen to the music and dance and clap to it.  He does seem to enjoy this more than the Baby Einstein player mentioned above, perhaps because he can change things up in a greater variety of ways.3) You hope that your child will start to recognize the sound of different instruments from this toy.  If you have any thought like this in your head, banish the thought of getting this toy - you will likely be disappointed with either version of it. You will certainly be disappointed on this count if you get the Munchkin version.  On the better, original Embryonics version of this toy, the piano and harp sound reasonably true to their real sound and the flute is recognizable on the higher notes, at least.  The french horn, however, is barely recognizable as a brass instrument, and doesn't have any of the beauty and timbre of sound that a real French horn does.  And the violin - forget it!  It doesn't even sound like a string instrument, and I doubt a child hearing the violin part on this cube and then hearing a real violin would hear any similarity.  On the newer Munchkin version, only the piano sounds like the same family of instrument - kind of like a harpsichord, as one musically-trained reviewer has noted.  The rest of the instruments sound like synthesized crap.  (I suspect that none of this will matter to you in the least if you just want a musical toy your child can interact with in some way, and despite this shortcoming, I think most toddlers would enjoy either version of the toy just because it is plays music and does so in an interactive way. Nonetheless, in this day of tiny, inexpensive high-quality music players, I don't get why they couldn't make this to sound more like real instruments, and to have better sound quality overall.)4) You would like to enjoy this toy with your child, or at least not be driven crazy by it while he is playing with it. As you can tell from what I've said already, I definitely agree with other reviewers that the newer Munchkin version of this toy has much inferior sound quality than its predecessor.  Not only are the Munchkin instrument sounds largely unrecognizable, but the music overall sounds tinny, with the result that it is really grating to listen to it for any length of time.  And if your kid likes this toy as much as ours does, you will be listening to it a LOT. I think that for this reason alone, it is probably worthwhile to check the listings until you can find the older Embryonics version of the music cube.  Even if you aren't especially musically inclined.  Then again, if your kid already has lots of toys that sing and make noise (mine doesn't), you may have developed the ability to tune out any kind of tinny synthesizer-produced ruckus, in which case you might as well save yourself the trouble of hunting down an Embryonics cube and just get the Munchkin version.Also, it is worth noting that the newer Munchkin version is marginally better-looking, in case that matters to anyone reading this review.  On the Embryonics version, all the sides are a somewhat drab yellow, with only the edges and centers of the cube offering any variety in color, whereas the Munchkin version is more colorful - this is the version pictured in all the product photos.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Depends on what you want from the toy", "unixReviewTime": 1357084800, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2013"}

As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.

You see, I bought that version at a secondhand store back when my three-year-old was a baby. It was a great toy, but the battery compartment was hard to take off and put on without breaking it. One day we brought it to a friend's house, and someone else's kid somehow broke the battery cover in such a way that my attempts to fix it with super glue were futile. I went back to the secondhand store to find the other one I had seen on my initial visit, but I didn't find it. I was bummed because I had really liked it! I came to Amazon to discover that Munchkin now made the music box, but the reviews comparing the old one to the new one kept me from buying it.A little while ago, I decided I still really missed the toy, and I now had another baby who might enjoy it. Thus I bought it because I figured we could return it if it was really that bad.I honestly think that it is better than the old one! It has nicer colors, an improved battery compartment cover, and better synchronization of the instruments.The Embryonics version was purple and yellow and, in my opinion, kind of ugly. As you can see in the pictures, the Munchkin version is all different colors and visually appealing.The sound quality is just as good, and the batteries get used up a little more slowly in the Munchkin version. The battery compartment cover now has two screws (rather than a screw and a tab that put stress on the cover every time you had to put it back on) plus a pull-out box that contains the three batteries.On the Embryonics version, sometimes the instruments were out of sync. We had this problem from the start. It just seemed that one or two instruments were slightly behind the others. We've used our Munchkin version plenty but haven't yet run into this problem.I'm not sure why some other reviewers are knocking the sound quality (whether or not it's compared to the Embryonics version). This isn't an orchestra; it's a child's toy. It introduces them to some new music plus some musical instruments they might not encounter otherwise. Do the individual instruments sound like the real thing? Kind of. But again, it's a child's toy. The sound quality does tend to suffer as the batteries start to die, but that's to be expected. It gets quieter and flatter, like the instruments are slightly out of tune.I'm generally not a big fan of noise-making toys, especially ones that play music because the music tends to be very annoying. I don't find the music from this box annoying; in fact, it bothered me so little that I sought out this particular toy two years after throwing out the original, broken one.My only complaint is that I wish the box had a lower volume setting. The music can be a little loud, especially when it's got new batteries. That would probably help retain some battery life, too.Overall, my baby loves this toy, and my 3-year-old, who loved it as a baby, still loves it. They actually play with it together, which is rare. The older one recognizes the instruments and likes to show his younger brother what they are.Oh, and if you're like me and hesitated to buy this because it's supposedly crappy compared to the Embryonics version, fret not and just order it. You'll be glad you did, and if you disagree, pack it back up and return it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Toy, Better Than the Embryonics Version", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2014"}

She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it.

I find myself playing with this toy, as do many of my daughter's young playmates and their parents too! Some of her older cousins, who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play. So far, this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago, but the product I received is pretty good too. The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds &#34;tinny&#34;, I didn't find that to be the case at all. I'm no music expert, but to my ears, each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me! I'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too. I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that's the case, I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy.

Here is why:1. This cube stimulates touch, sight, and sound in a creative way. Each side of the cube has a different instrument and a different color: violin--yellow; harp--pink; french horn--orange; flute--purple; piano--green; orchestra--blue.2. When your child touches a side of the cube, it lights up and the instrument starts playing. Touch a second side, and the second instrument plays in sync with the first one (which is still playing), etc. If you want to hear everything at once, just hit the orchestra button.3. There are no sharp corners. Instead each corner is rounded and has yellow, purple, green and red colors.4. There is an easy on/off switch to conserve battery power when the cube is not in use.5. As the name indicates, the cube plays music from Mozart. I have read the most negative review complaining about the sound and that this cube is not as good as the original Embryonics cube. While I have not heard that cube, I have played Mozart pieces on the piano and also have CDs of various of his works, so I am familiar with his music. For a toddler the quality of the music on this cube is just fine, so don't let that negative review discourage you from buying this product.Bottom line: This is a well made quality toy.Update May 20, 2012: My now 16 month old granddaughter still loves to play with this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Marvelous toy for infants and toddlers", "unixReviewTime": 1311984000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2011"}

This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I didn't mind buying another seat.Yes, it \"fits\" elongated toilets. But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps, no pegs, no rubber feet, nothing! Every time my daughter tried to sit down, the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard. If I start with the little seat as far back as possible, it's too far for her to get on without help (she's nearly 3!) and once on, her feet don't touch her fairly tall step stool. It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it won't stay there. So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on.

This thing collects pee. The little pee guard is pointless. From what I've seen pee guards are needed by some kids, not by others - regardless of sex. My daughter needs one - a decent one. This one just deflects her pee all over the seat, the floor, her pants, her shoes. In short, a drippy, nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry.

I'd done quite a bit of research on baby gates before purchasing this one at Babies R Us, but in trying to save a few dollars, I first went to Wal-Mart and bought a metal top-of-the-stairs gate, but I decided to take it back since it had a raised \"platform\" (for lack of a better word) piece at the bottom.  I think that platform was meant for extra sturdiness, but I saw it as an accident waiting to happen.  I returned that gate before we even installed it.  This gate doesn't have that \"platform\" and it is still very sturdy.  Another nice feature about this is that you can just slip the gate out of its brackets to remove it if you are having a party or have to run up and down the stairs without needing to swing the gate out of your way.  And when you are ready to put it back, just line the gate up with the brackets and slide it in place.  Really nice feature for us when we were moving our daughter's furniture from one room to the other and downstairs, we didn't have the gate in our way since we removed the swing arm.  Overall, we are very pleased and would buy this gate again if we had to.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Luv this gate", "unixReviewTime": 1182297600, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2007"}

If 'Evenflo' addresses these, this gate will easily merit a top score.  Let me start with the positives.  The gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood.  It works well and looks great, IF the install goes well, and as EXACTLY specified (included paper template is great).  The mechanical 'lock latch' inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it 'click into place', which gives one peace of mind.  Of course, one hopes that 'Evenflo' has determined this type of latch to be one that is not 'easily defeated' by the age group that it was manufactured/intended for (6 months to 2 years)!  Thankfully, it does seem like it is up to the task.  I also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into, thus adding reinforcement to BOTH the top and bottom portions of this gate.  Way to go 'Evenflo'!  The negatives about the gate are as follows. In many typical installations, there will be baseboard molding/trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom-most latch receptacle. It did in my case, even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor, as specified in the assembly directions.  Thus, I wasn't able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw.  I had to thus cut (with a hacksaw) that portion of the latch receptacle, and 'modify' it for my installation.  I then was only able to use 1 screw (although a larger and longer one than provided), instead of 2, to install the bottom latch receptacle.  Thankfully, even just the modified 1 screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood.  'Evenflo' should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor.  Besides, MOST typical homes DO have some kind of baseboard molding, and mine was only 1/1/2\" high, hardly anything large.  Lastly, the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top, and which on the bottom.  They are NOT the same dimensions, as one is thicker than the other (top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one).  Of course, the aforementioned 'latch receptacle' install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation, especially if you don't have floor baseboard molding.  In summation, this gate is STURDY and EXCELLENT, and a good value.  PLEASE, just make sure you do install it correctly (as per the instructions), and NEVER leave your baby alone unsupervised.  These gates are meant to be used WITH proper supervision, and never as a replacement for.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "VERY GOOD gate!

If I had noticed it was evenflo, I wouuld not have wasted my time. It was a pain to install. Total PAIN. Then, when it's unlocked, it slides for adjustment. The thing is, there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm. We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that. IF we had known about the second risk, we would have just taken it down then. THe next morning, it was kid tested. Yeah, all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward. So far, I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position. MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD. Not to mention broken bones. The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes, when you go to unlock it, sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot. I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open. Also, the gate now leans. When opened, it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate. Not sure how that came about. We have had this gate for a couple of months. My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling. My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break. Not a good gate at all. Evenflo just needs to stop.

It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!!

The price we found to be very comparable to other walkers.  We really didn't notice any pros or cons to this particular walker over others.The main problem that we've run into with both of our daughters is the fact that that they really enjoyed the toys for about 1 month at the maximum.  After that they got bored and soon started fussing to get out and roll around on the floor.Our first daughter used the walker part of it for almost a week before again getting tired of it as the fact is, something along these lines is just too tough for a little one to control by themselves.  If you can imagine pushing a shopping cart that wants to go it's own way that's the way it is with the walker.

With that said, understand that you'll have to walk with them to help them steer.Overall I remain convinced that a walker is good for kids to have so they have something other than their parent to hold onto to learn to walk but be prepared to help them walk in it because of the above mentioned bulkiness of the walker and the fact that I've never come across any walker from any company that's been easy enough for a little one to steer and push at the same time.5 stars for the idea and the toys but I had to take 1 star away for the difficulty to steer and another star for the limited time that my daughters used it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Be prepared to help your baby", "unixReviewTime": 1137715200, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2006"}

Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn't absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don't need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It's very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it's rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren't detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don't think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn't strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that's easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it's assembled it's not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don't move them much either.)-It's surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I'm not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I'm still very happy--it's easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA \"toy\" for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We've been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.

With the holidays coming and some overnight stays expected, I wanted one that was easy to put together and fold up and go QUICKLY.  I read numerous reviews on Amazon on several pack n plays.  I kept coming back to this one mostly b/c of the bright colors. I was basically sold when I read one review that stated a 14 year old put this together in less than a minute.  NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  I'm a single mom and have absolutely no patience for something that is complicated.  My mom and I put the graco pack n play with the changing table together and it was very difficult. I think it took over an hour to put together with another person.  The review I read was dead on.  I took the totbloc pack n play out of the box and had it together within 2 minutes.  My 9 month old baby loves it.  it is VERY ROOMY inside.  She has not slept in it yet since I only got it today.  The bottom is fairly quilted and I don't think she will have a problem with napping in it.  She loves the bugs on the 4 sides too.  The bright colors are great.  I'm sure we will be using this for a long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So cute and baby LOVED it!", "unixReviewTime": 1319846400, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2011"}

Both my girls are 11 months old right now and can pull themselves up just enough to chew on the top rails.So if you're looking for something to use with twins, definately buy this.

Kids enjoy playing with the bugs and each offers something slightly different. The bee has its two wings extended inside of the playpen and the wings make a rattling noise when moved. The butterfly's wings are also extended inside the playpen and they offer the sound of paper being crinkled. The ladybug has a squeak toy inside its body to create its own unique sound and the sun has a mirror for a child's enjoyment. Each offers its own type of stimulation and since they are built in, they are always there. There is no need to worry that the toys will be lost.Besides the toys, the other reason kid's love the Graco Tot Block with Bugs is for its bright colors. Most playpens are dark blue or dark green in color and offer nothing that is visually appealing. This pack and play, however, offers combinations of bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Babies seem more entranced with this playpen than with the plain colored playpens. They like looking at the bright colors and playing with the interactive, built- in toys on the sides of the playpen.Like other pack and plays, Graco Tot Block folds up for easy storage. You need to remove the pad from the inside before you fold the unit because the pad acts as a cover for the rest of the playpen. Once you have the playpen folded, it slips inside of the pad using Velcro straps to secure it in place. Once the pad has been wrapped, the entire unit then slips into a plastic bag with a zipper to keep it shut. This is simple enough, but I have noticed that this pack and play weighs a little more than others and it is also a little more awkward to remove and set up. It helps to have a second person to open it up and prepare it for use. But this is only a minor inconvenience because it can still be set up with little effort.With all of the stimulation offered with this playpen, there is one possible disadvantage: It could keep your child from falling asleep. If your goal for buying this playpen is strictly to have a place for your youngster to play, then the added stimulation will be an asset. But if you want to place your child in the playpen for a quick nap, you might have some difficulty due to the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys. These toys cannot be removed from the walls of the playpen so they could definitely create a distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids up to approximately two years of age. If your child is older, then you should not use this playpen because he/she might be able to climb out. Most kids age two or under, however, will be small enough to use this playpen. Also, even though there is no defined limit for the number of kids who can play inside this device, I think it should be limited to two. Any more than two and the kids will begin to get frustrated with the constant bumping into each other.Overall, this is a very good pack and play from Graco and it ranks among my child's favorite playpens. The colors and interactive, built in toys make it a favorite among all kids and while it does weigh a little more than other pack and plays and does require more effort to unpack and set up, it still makes a good choice for parents of small children.

The first two didn't need a playpen, but my 8 month old baby is the most adventurous yet. Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies, little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper, anything. I'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie, or something will fall off of a counter, and he will get it. He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him, so we have them bungie corded to the table legs. Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam, but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer. Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes. He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer. We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued. So far he likes it. He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail. I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh. I've checked out two of the sides. One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror. They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house. They have a dog that chews his toys (and the baby's) to bits. And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays.

I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup--they both take about a minute to put up. The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness--the graco feels lighter than the Delta (a good 5 lbs+), but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up, and seems slightly more durable.Shape--the graco is very squared off, and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape. This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress--the graco has a very bright, colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it. It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable. The pad also lays flat, but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while. The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides. The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco, but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco. Even though it's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier. No dip in the middle, and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh---they both seem to have equally durable mesh. The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price--the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice. I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for. If it's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare, etc. I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use. If you are using it to bring around with you places (hotel, camping, on the back deck, grandma's, etc). then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around, and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with. The graco also seems sturdy and durable; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments; that's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing!!  Wish I had bought one sooner!

I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens.  You would think they are the same, but they are not.  The pack n plays are great for naps, (I would say 18 months and younger), and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies.  I have used those strictly for naps, as they are not that stable or large enough for play.  This square playpen is ideal!!!  It is so sturdy.  Easy to set up, take down.  Perfect for when you need to get something done.  It keeps those walking and crawling confined, but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys.  The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it, whereas the pack n play, he hated it.  Couldn't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done.  Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys, he doesn't mind it.  Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping.  In my honest opinion, the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib, but foster services states you have to have a crib, not playard for sleeping.  I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors.  It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular.  It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far.  But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays, and you could transport it to a grandparents house, or babysitter, or the park.  Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays.  This has been a lifesaver!!  In my opinion, works better than using those portable plastic pens.  I tried that, didn't last long.  Wouldn't go back to that, and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat.  It is very substantial and seems to work fine.  However, I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house, it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room.  These square ones do not have wheels, so if you needed something really portable, you might want the rectangular.  If you are using for both play and sleep, I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen, so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Has been a lifesaver!!

I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "not quality I expected; not a good napping pack n play", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013"}

The base is also attractive with lots of colors for baby to 'discover'.There is a play thing on each side - crinkly butterfly, mirror, squeezy sound making ladybug, and rattly bee.  It's large - about 38in square so you'll need some room to place it.  The flipside is that baby has plenty of room to play.  You can store baby's toys in there and still they space to play.It has mesh sides for airflow and so that parents can see in and babies can see out.  It's relatively quick to fold away for travel due to a button on each top arm which 'folds' that side.  A very neat idea.  However, that's where the good stuff ends because there are two major flaws with this product.Why do manufactuers insist on producing fabric based items for a baby that cannot be WASHED ???  Why oh why do they not make the fabric removable - do they not know that kids make a MESS ???  Duh !!!  How is one supposed to remove spit-up and drool (and possibly worse!)?It's perhaps the most important thing in any piece of baby equipment; be it a chair, car seat, pushchair, crib, or playpen.  THE FABRIC SHOULD BE REMOVABLE FOR WASHING.The second issue is that the base pad is only about 3/4 in thick.  That in itself is not so much of an issue as the fact that when it's placed inside the playpen, it 'dips' in the middle - by about 1/2in.  The centre strut /leg that holds the pad sems to be lower than the other legs  causing a dip in the middle (and yes it's on a flat surface).  Although baby hasn't yet 'rolled' into the center, it's not very comforting knowing that the center is not flat.  Perhaps the pad should have been thicker - better yet the center leg should have been the same size as the others.For what we paid, I don't think it's worth the money - especially considering that the pad can't be cleaned without using chmical cleaners (which we don't intend to use around baby).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not worth the money due to the flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1369180800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2013"}

We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n' play.  Like probably most other parents, we already have the obligatory pack n' play.  It's small and cozy and our son likes it fine.  I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed: another pack n' play she did not want.  (She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9' by 9', but that's another story.)Well, we could have returned it with the free returns, but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in, we were hooked and so was he.  Here's why it's ten times better than your average pack n' play:1.  The colors are so vibrant--reds, blue, green, yellow--as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n' play.2.  Each wall of the pack n' play has a different feature: for instance, one wall has a ladybug that squeaks; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles; another has a bee that also moves and rustles; and another has a sun with a mirror on it.  Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I've ever seen, it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.3.  It's sturdier than any pack n' play I've seen, and the walls don't budge when he stands up in it, but it's also squishy enough to withstand falls.  I've seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it, and he hasn't seemed bothered.  Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.4.

Nielsen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you're looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole. We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up, although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred. We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter, who has just reached her first birthday. Of the two, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, although neither has caused the dreaded \"nipple confusion.\" In both cases, we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type. This is how the two compare:1. The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with. Throw out the old liner, pop in a new one, fill it up, and you're ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby. No bottle brush or hot, soapy water needed.2. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).3. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider, and if she falls asleep, the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets, and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both. For convenience and fast clean-up, the Playtex Drop-In system wins. For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy, the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Convenient clean-up, but Playtex VentAire nipples work better for breastfed babies", "unixReviewTime": 1331424000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2012"}

Why? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old, we bought some other bottles that don't use a liner. After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them. They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles. Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies. When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths. I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once(the more bottles the merrier) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths. I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners, that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner. Since we've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles...and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS, what a stinky mess. Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean. With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review. I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins. Except for water or juice, cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins. It might cost more in liners but you'll be Thankful in the long run. My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners, we've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner. Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up. Make sure you have plenty on hand so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners.

I purchased these bottles before my son, who is now 10 weeks old, was born. I planned to breastfeed exclusively. I planned to pump into these bottles. I even took a reviewers advice and got extra large bottles and short liners (which I wouldn't advise to anyone). I liked the idea of not needing to wash a million bottles. I didn't have a dishwasher at the time. (We now do... and maybe I would have stuck with these had that not been the case). I also have a psychotic cat that continually custom selected baby items from the dish drying rack. Drove me nuts.Nothing went to plan. I ended up supplementing my breast milk with formula after one month. My son eats a ton and these bottles don't really do well with formula.POWDERED FORMULAPowdered formula (which I can't stand) doesn't mix well in this bottle. Also, despite the wonderful design for keeping air out... you have to shake powdered formula. Thus, there's air in there and your baby will be gassy.LIQUID (RTF) FORMULAFormula is expensive. Pushing the air out of the bag is a GREAT concept. But when the bag exploded on me twice... I was upset. And reading reviews, I have to say I thought people were just pushing to quickly and clearly that would never happen to me. But it did. Twice. And with a screaming baby... it's really better to have bottles that are ready to go. (Even if prepared, you need to push air out of the bottle... and that takes time).BREASTMILKI don't pump enough to fill these bottles. Pumping takes a lot of time. So.. After I pump my four ounces, I don't want it to explode. And I don't want it to go bad from having so much exposure to air... And if I'm pumping, I'm not feeding my child right away. He eats all the time. Thus, I stopped \"expressing\" because it seemed to be a waste of time. Why pump into a bottle just to feed it to him right away? (I'm empty after I finish pumping). Now... in the first few weeks, my son killed my nipples. So, pumping into the bottle came in handy. The pump was much kinder. I didn't care if he destroyed silicone. (He didn't... but I'm just sayin'!).I had no problem with the lids on these bottles. I actually prefer these caps to the \"newer\" ones I found at Babies R Us (for a much higher price). The plastic is sturdy. I liked the silicone nipples because I could boil them (and now I can put them in the dishwasher). This brand is kind of wonderful because they make a variety of bottles and the nipples can be used with different bottles.I didn't hate the bottle enough to say you shouldn't try it. But I didn't like it enough to continue using it. You do not need \"extra\" exterior bottles. The set comes with enough. The comparison would be like buying a bunch of vaccuums for your vaccuum bags. Since you don't need to wash the exterior anyway... what you have is plenty.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Concept", "unixReviewTime": 1332288000, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2012"}

I read all of the online reviews and decided I would get a couple of each type and try them all.  I have the Avent bottles, Dr. Brown's, Gerber, you name it, I have a ton of them.I exclusively breatfeed my baby and everyday he gets a bottle with his medicine in it along with the bottles I pump for when we will be somewhere that's difficult to breastfeed.  In my opinion, this system is HANDS-DOWN THE BEST.Here's what I like:The liners are sterile so you can always be sure your baby is drinking out of a clean bottle.Nothing to wash but the nipple and ring.  Its so quick and easy, especially when you are in a hurry or in the middle of the night when its harder to think straight.  When he's done, just toss the drop in and wash the nipple and you are ready for your next bottle.My baby didn't struggle with swallowing air using this bottle like the others I tried because you push the air out.  It worked much better for him than the Dr. Brown's bottles.  Using these, he didn't struggle with gas pains afterwards.He switched with no problems from a very early age between the breast and this bottle type.  It comes with various nipples to try and the breastfeeding nipple works great for him.Here is the only downside:You cannot pump directly into the liners - but that is not a big deal to me.  I pump into the Medela CSF bags and store those.  When I am ready to make a bottle, I pour it out of the CSF bag and into the liner.

I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle.

It is correct, and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time. All of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it's done. I honestly cannot understand how people could say they read the directions and it still didn't work, but hey that's just me. Definitely recommend!

We needed to block off a hallway in our basement, but had uneven walls, and this gate works perfectly.  The installation was a little bit involved, since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls, but it only took about 20 minutes and we had it up.Some tips for installing the gate:1.  First, read through the entire instruction manual before you start.  The way the manual is structured, there are instructions in several languages in the front, and then reference pictures in the back.  If you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start, it makes the installation go pretty smoothly.2.  Try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls.  Since you can configure the gate to any length/angle by changing the angle of each joint, try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall, so you don't have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out.3.  Try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a 10 degree angle.  If you put them straight across, the gate will flex a little bit.  It doesn't really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls, but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionOverall, this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and I would highly recommend it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth Every Penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1316995200, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2011"}

First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.  If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.

I couldn't have done it without this Avent pump. As a first time mother, I always knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be. My son had trouble latching on in the hospital, and so, until he could breastfeed consistently (I went to a lactation consultant and she worked wonders), I was pumping my breast milk for him. At the hospital, they provided me with a Medela manual pump. It was PAINFUL. I eventually got calluses from pumping with the Medela pump. So then I was considering whether to buy the Medela electric or the Avent Isis, and I went for the Avent, a much more economical buy.

POUR out all over the floor, and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too!I ended up with a full set of these bottles (without the ring) and one that required the ring (which I felt leaked less), I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles, so I dealt with these for 11 months. I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer!What's the trick? Well, the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts (sorry if this doesn't make sense). You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top. This requires two hands, so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly. Once you have them lined up, now screw on the top. You have to make sure it is nice and tight. Now, shake it and see.... it leaks! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight, so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage. Take it off and try again. Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I cannot wait to throw them all in the trash.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Finicky Bottles Drove Me CRAZY!", "unixReviewTime": 1304985600, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2011"}

I nursed my 2nd child exclusively for 13 months, and I used this pump to express milk so that my husband could feed him.  He never really took on the bottle, but that's a different story.  Anyway, I just couldn't justify having to spend a couple of hundred dollars for a pump--maybe if I was working and wanted to continue breastfeeding, I probably would have.

I had no problem expressing 4 ounces of milk in about 10 minutes, and it didn't hurt either--it actually felt comfortable.  I had the Evenflo electric pump for my first child--now that one was very uncomfortable--it felt like it was sucking the life out of you.

I was gone for 3 days, and I did not want my milk supply to dwindle down, so this pump helped a lot.  I was able to express some before I left so she would have some breastmilk along with formula supplement while I was gone.

I'm assuming it was due to the stress.  While I was at the hosptal, I used their Ameda Elite hospital pump, but at home, I was pumping full time with this pump.  It gets the job done quickly and the handle is very comfortable.The milk can leak out the sides, which can be very upsetting, especially if you're pumping for a hospitalized newborn and you need every drop you can get.  You just have to make sure to keep the pump perfectly upright.  Don't tilt it at all!I didn't have any problems with creaking, and if I did, I'd just take it apart and put it together and the problem was solved.I also know some had problems with the milk getting backed up and the silicone star not letting the milk flow to the container, but you just have to be sure to release the handle completely so the milk can flow out.  Another way to get it into the container is the break the suction between the pump and breast and pump the handle a few times.This pump worked great and I was able to come up with ways to avoid problems until I had used it (full time) for a month and a half.  The star would start getting sucked up into the top even if I slightly pumped the handle.  I emailed Avent and they emailed me back and had some great tips (great customer service, by the way!).  They said to boil the silicone parts for 10 minutes in water and 2 teaspoons of white vinegar... and viola! Problem solved.  If you use it as much as I did, the tackiness of the silicone wears and has to be fixed by the boiling.Lastly, I read some had problems getting everything to fit in the bag.  It takes talent, I tell you!  My advice is this: Remember how it was packaged in the first place!  Before you take it out of the bag, take note of how it's arranged.  After several attempts, I finally got it all back in.All in all, it's a great pump if you don't want to invest in an electric pump, or if you're only pumping occationally and you work around some of the little issues.  In those instances, I'd definitely recommend it!  I have an Ameda Purely Yours as well, and overall, I'd suggest paying the extra money and get an electric if you're working or having to pump full time, or you just want more convience.I hope this review helps, as I wanted it to be my best, considering all the experience I've had with so many pumps!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Pump, but Has Little Quirks", "unixReviewTime": 1113091200, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2005"}

One of them went back to work and bought Medela just for pumping at work. I simply got this set to use both at home & work, and am I glad that I didn't need electric pump to express milk quickly - with ISIS, I can get 1 oz foremilk in less than a minute! Of course it takes a little longer for hindmilk because the pressure from the breast is less by then. On average it takes less than 10 minutes to pump 4-5 oz.I was back to work 2 weeks ago & have been using it twice a day. Before this I used it 1-2 times a day to pump a ounce or so foremilk for 6 weeks, and it works very well for me. All the parts are sturdy. You just have to make sure that you don't turn the connecting \"neck\" while pumping, else you'll drop the bottle!The numerous parts are a little daunting to assemble in the beginning, but you'll be an expert in no time. Just be careful with the little white valve when washing the parts, without it the pump won't work. But the kit does have extra valves.The insulated carrying bag is attractive and discrete. There's even a non-transparent drawstring pouch for storing breastmilk-filled bottles in the common fridge at work where everyone keeps their lunches!

Of course, you can only pump one side at a time, but I actually like haveing the other hand free to read or email.The AVENT instructions say that some users can use the pump without the \"cushion.\" I did it this way first because when I was putting it together I did not see the petal cushion. It worked great. When I later found the petal cushion, and tried it - the pump did not work as well for me. So if you are having problems with the pump try it without the cushion.

The hospital grade electric pumps did not have cushions, so that was what I was used to anyway.My only complaint is that the star vaulve is annoying. It sometimes falls out - while pumping and suction is lost and you have to take the whole thing apart to put the star vaulve back in. For this reason, I like the cheapo Medela hand pump a little better.But for all you out there deciding between electric and manual - I am one user telling you that I get EXACTLY the same results with this manual as with an electric.

Mine came with a 3M tape, and the installation seems very sticky. They are certainly installed firmly enough that my toddler daughter will not be able to pull them off, and that was the whole point. The only reasons I knocked off a couple stars are:1. The installation tape comes in pre-cut strips, so you have to use several of them. It would have been better if they sent a roll of the double sided tape instead. If the tape was in one roll, that would also make installation of the foam strip easier because you could put one piece of tape on the foam, and just pull the backing away from the two ends to get it aligned properly before pulling off the rest of the backing and securing the middle of the strip to the table.2. The foam strip develops something of a shape memory from being rolled up in the package, and by the time you get to the center of the roll, you really have to fight against that curved shaped to install the tape and get the strip installed on the table in a straight manner. It would have been better if it came in strips (perhaps two 6-foot strips or four 3-foot strips), but I do realize this would have also increased the shipping cost.3. There were no directions included.

They are soft enough that when my 18 month old hits his head directly on the corner he doesn't even flinch.-Long strips both with and without the corners used on table edges and on my bottom step:  I have a ledge/stoop inside my house near the backdoor and it has sharp metal edges nailed in along the entire length.  It makes a bend so I needed these strips to stick to metal on a step and not come off when we hit the edges or my son slides down on his rear.  This works like a charm.The edges have not peeled off metal, it was extremely easy to install and there was more than enough tape strips/squares given.  The double stick tape makes application quick and easy.I would highly recommend this product.*FOR A CHEAPER but not so pretty ALTERNATIVE:  Head to your local home improvement store and get pipe covers/insulation which are foam and come in varied sizes.  THey have a precut slit down the length so you can open it up and slide it on the edges of tables.  You'd need to tape it somehow but each strip is long and costs less than a dollar.

However, my wife and I are yet to experience the miraculous calming effects at the dinner table that so many other reviews have mentioned.The Booster is made from one solid piece soft foam material.  The material is very lightweight and cleans up very easily.  The one-piece construction also aids in clean-up - no cracks to trap food or let spills get through to your furniture.  Plus, the material grips on wooden chairs;  it's never budged when our active two-year-old is using it.  This ease of use, both at the table and when getting washed in the sink, are its major selling points.On the other hand, the one-piece construction makes the bulky Booster less than ideal for use away from home.  Forget about using it at restaurants because it's not different enough from what they'll provide.  We only take ours out when we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's house for a few days;  otherwise, it's more trouble than it's worth.  Sure, it's lightweight, but the supplied carrying case is roughly the size of a bowling ball bag.  Plus, the bag is very cheap and unattractive;  basically they're selling you the packaging as a carrying case.Lastly, we haven't seen the Booster effect any great improvement in our son's attention span at the table - when he wants to get down, he wants to get down, period.  I don't believe that any booster seat could make such a difference in toddler behavior, so I don't hold it against this one;  I'm just surprised how many others have reported these results.  If anything, our son is frustrated by the Booster because its size prevents him from climbing into his chair unassisted.  Because he's in the toddler independence phase, he'd often rather climb into another chair by himself rather than be lifted into the Booster.So, the Booster does a great job of providing a simple-to-use and easy-to-maintain solution at home, but if you take your little one out frequently, a more portable options would suit you better.PROS*  Stable, soft foam stays in place without marking chairs*  Very easy to clean with one-piece constructionCONS*  Bulky on the go*  Will frustrate toddlers who like to climb into their own chair", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Good Booster but Not the Perfect Solution", "unixReviewTime": 1113177600, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2005"}

Maybe it is our particular toilet or something, but the splashing created from sitting so close to the edge of the toilet makes quite a mess. The urine gets on the toilet seat, between the bjorn and the seat, and on the bjorn itself- up under the edges.Honestly, I'm not really sure how the device could be improved to prevent this issue.

{"reviewerID": "A8PP8NPRJSAKO", "asin": "B000056J76", "reviewerName": "Brazilian Jazzaholic!", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "We bought a couple of stand-alone potty seats a few months ago when our daughter was about 20 months old.  Although she was mildly intrigued by them at first and quickly learned what they were for, she seemed to view them more as glorified chairs rather than places to do her business.  Now that she's nearing the two-and-a-half year mark, we decided to buy a toilet trainer seat to see if that would get her more engaged in the potty training process.  After reading tons of potty seat reviews, I decided to purchase this BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer, since it's one of the few on the market that's made of BPA-free, non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead of toxic PVC or vinyl.  As an added bonus, this toilet trainer seat is fully adjustable to fit practically any size toilet seat.  We have oval-shaped, elongated toilet seats in our home, and the BabyBjorn potty seat fits them perfectly.  This toilet trainer doesn't slide around at all on the toilet seat, which helps my little-one to feel more secure while sitting on it.  Despite the exact fit, the toilet trainer seat is so easy to put on and remove that a preschooler could probably do it unassisted.  There's a handy loop at the back of the seat so that you can hang it nearby for easy storage.  (We hang it on aPotty Hookthat hooks over our toilet tank).As I said in the title of this review, the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer would be just about perfect, if only it had handles for little-ones to hold onto.  Apparently, when toddlers first begin to use the \"grown-up toilet,\" many of them experience an innate fear of falling in, even when using a potty seat insert like this one.  Handles can help alleviate this fear by giving them something to hold onto to anchor themselves while sitting on the potty seat.  This was the case with my daughter.  When sitting on this toilet trainer seat, she couldn't relax enough to urinate, much less have a bowel movement.  She would either hold my hands or grab onto the sides of the (unsanitary) toilet seat in order to steady herself, but even then, she still couldn't relax enough to do her business.  On a hunch, I tried theArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary, which is one of the few polypropylene potty seats that has handles.  The first time we used that seat, my daughter immediately grabbed onto the handles and peed for the first time in the toilet!  However, the Arm & Hammer potty seat is too small for my elongated toilet seat, and it's not adjustable, so it constantly slides around when my daughter is on it.  And unfortunately, none of the adjustable potty seats that are readily available on the market (the BabyBjorn, Pourty Flexi-Fit and Prince Lionheart WeePod), has handles.I thought we were doomed to be stuck with the ill-fitting Arm & Hammer potty seat until I came across a nifty product called the \"SHANDLE\". The Shandle is a handle that sticks to the underside of your toilet seat with a strong, moisture-proof adhesive strip.  It's intended to help little boys avoid touching the germy toilet seat by providing a more sanitary grab-handle for lifting and lowering the seat.  But the Shandle has turned out to be a perfect solution for us to the problem of using the handle-less BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer seat.  We just stuck a Shandle on each side of our toilet seat (around the same place that our daughter would grab onto the toilet seat), and voila!  She had two, secure handles to hold onto to anchor herself has she used the toilet trainer seat.  It doesn't hurt that the Shandle comes in a variety of kid-friendly designs such as dinosaurs, martians and robots, which makes them attractive to toddlers.  (It also comes in elegant fashion prints and plain white, for those who prefer their bathrooms to have a more adult look).  Our daughter isn't yet fully potty-trained, but now she's comfortable enough to pee in the toilet while using her BabyBjorn potty seat, and she looks forward to using the \"big potty.\"  (So much so that she's pretty much lost interest in her stand-alone \"baby\" potty!)If you've been holding off on getting this BabyBjorn potty seat because it doesn't have handles, please Google \"Shandle\" and consider giving the product a try.  It was the perfect solution for us.Grade: A- (1 star deducted because the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer doesn't have built-in handles).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Would be perfect if it had handles!

Child doesn't fall through hole (holds little behinds securely).6. Easily removeable for adult use of toilet.7. Carrying handle is great for kids and sanitary for moving the seat around.The only reason I did not give this seat 5 stars is if a little boy is sitting to go #1, you really have to make sure his \"aim\" is down otherwise as the force of urine stream hits the deflector it can splash up onto his legs a bit (nothing a bit of TP can't hande, though). If the deflector were a tad higher this problem probably would go away. The other issue is that if his \"aim\" isn't directed either right in the center of the deflector or right down into the bowl, the urine can splatter up under the deflector and make its way onto the toilet seat, toilet rim, and/or the back of the kid's pants if the clothing is not pushed down beyond the gap between the toilet seat and rim.No problems with #2.Don't forsee any trouble with little girl use either (daughter will use this seat in about 1 1/2 years).Despite the deflector issue - I would buy this product again there are too many other great attributes of it.

Further, it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides; they flow down into the toilet as they should.  The solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor.Further, the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung, by the large attached loop, to dripdry.

We wipe it down occasionally, but its wonderful design keeps it from getting waste on it, and keeps germs from accumulating.Lastly, it's easy to install for any toilet.

My daughter is almost a year old. I had started, earlier this summer, putting her on the regular potty when I noticed her struggling with a #2. So rather than watching her be uncomfortable as she sat in her diaper or stood on her hands and feet in awkward positions, I decided to take her to the potty. It was tiring and uncomfortable holding her on the regular toilet seat, but using the toilet was effective at helping my daughter do the job she needed to do, plus I've saved several diapers this way.After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Babybjorn Toilet Trainer. It is perfect! My daughter seems comfortable on it, and I don't have to use as much strength to support her on the toilet since the Babybjorn seat provides a better and more stable sitting surface without me having to worry about her little bottom sinking into the toilet.I have a very small bathroom and just recently purchased a Potty Hook from Babies R Us.

Miller", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "[updated]This is one of two potty seats we use in the house with our HUGE 3 year old son (45 pounds, 42\" tall).The seat is well constructed, and has some nice features. In particular, it has two braces which can be moved by turning a dial accessible while the seat is on the toilet, to make the potty seat tightly held in the toilet seat, and therefore stable. That's nice.The plastic is smooth and easy to clean. And unfortunately, I spend a lot of time cleaning this potty seat and around it when my boy pees sitting down. Originally I thought this was because of the potty seat design.The front splash guard is raised to keep the child from missing the potty entirely, which is great. However, it's not aimed downward but instead is straight up and down. Unless I'm extremely careful to position him towards the very back of the potty seat (a problem if he will poo), my son winds up hitting himself, the toilet seat, and for all I know the ceiling when he pees. Worse, the pee splashes up underneath the potty seat and pools around the inside of the black rubber seal around the potty seat's edge. It's a mess, and requires cleaning the toilet seat every time I remove the potty seat from top of it.I guess I should consider this incentive to get him to learn to point down when he pees, but when you're potty training and just trying to get your kid to use the toilet at all, it's a pain.So, five star construction, comfort for sitting, and the adjustable fit. 3 stars for hygeine and spraying my son with his own pee. Average is four stars.Addendum: Since writing this review I've used a few other potty seats, which has improved my opinion of THIS one. Unfortunately unless you teach your boy to aim downwards, pee is going all kinds of places you don't want with pretty much any potty seat. This potty seat's front piece extends further down than a travel potty seat, for example, which is good. In this potty seat, there's sprayback, but in a travel potty seat, the pee can actually shoot UNDER the toilet seat and above the toilet, at the hapless parent foolish enough to stand in front of the boy. And I get some sprayback. So, given a choice between these two design options, I think the babybjorn probably makes the right choice. Bumping the star rating from 3 to 4 to reflect this.

We were using (without any luck) the Prince Lionheart weePod. The BB toilet trainer by comparison #1 has the dial adjustment to fit any toilet, long or round.

No need to try & get suction cups to try & keep the seat stable. #3 the splash guard is not so huge & in the way. My daughter was having such a hard time getting herself up, on & over the hump on the weePod. This may be a downside for boys, but is a bonus for girls. #4 You can hang it. I put a command hook a few inches below the tp roll & that's where we hang it between uses. My daughter is able to get it herself and place it on herself. All key things in her independence. And there's no putting it on wrong because the positioning is always right. #5 This is completely personal reasoning, but for some reason the fact that it is hard plastic rather than squishy soft material (in my head) makes it seem more sanitary. Or maybe because its clean & white, idk. That being said, when I say hard plastic, it is not by all means uncomfortable. The way it is shape gives the right alignment to be sitting on it.

Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous; they have to be lifted.  When they try to maneuver around it, the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side.

However, the younger one has a bit of difficulty sitting down on the larger one because of the shield in the front. She often gets so frustrated with the larger potty that she tries to turn the receptacle around, which of course, doesn't help matters.This small potty has been an ideal solution. It's reasonably priced, and the perfect size for a child under 2 years who is learning to use the potty or just has potty curiousity after watching an older sibling use the potty. We knew buying it that it will likely be a temporary potty, and that when she's too big for it, she can graduate to the larger one.My only complaints are as follows:-Judging from the marks on her bum, I don't believe that it's quite as comfortable as the larger version for long periods of sitting, and she's our second to have that tendency to \"camp\" on the potty.-The ease of dumping it is somewhat less that the larger Bjorn potty. Where we can rinse the receptacle for the larger one in the bathroom sink, this one is just large enough that we have to rinse it in the bathtub, and there's a bit more area that needs to be cleaned, with it all being one piece. Since we don't really plan on making it the long-term potty, and more just a trainer, this isn't such a big deal.So, if you're looking for a small potty for a younger child that will temporarily suit them perfectly, look no further.

We're still only using it to allow her to adapt to its presence since they don't have potties for her to use at daycare, but I absolutely love this potty and so does she!The only one thing that has given us a hard time is that she has figured out how to \"scoot\" around on it which was making it more of a vehicle than a potty.

While she is still too small to actually sit on it by herself (she'd fall right in), we hold her over it when we think she needs to empty the tank and have had much success with it.  Before you jump down my throat over why I shouldn't be using this for such a tiny baby, I'll defend myself by saying sometimes she will fuss uncontrollably and it will calm her immediately to have her diaper removed and have the opportunity to relieve herself without the confines of a diaper.  This potty has been a wonderful solution to that problem.It's definitely small, but since my baby is a particularly petite baby to begin with, I reckon she'll probably be close to completely potty trained before she outgrows this.  It's a nice size for us right now, however.Cleaning it is relatively simple with dumping the waste into the toilet, rinsing it out, then wiping it down with disinfecting wipes.  One feature I really would love to have in this is a pour spout somewhere to make dumping the waste a cleaner task.  Because of this lack of design feature, you are faced with two options when emptying the potty out: flip it upside-down really fast to avoid getting waste spread around the edges (never tried it...sounds too risky) or pour it out over the side and be faced with the waste spreading all over the side you dumped it from.  I'm sure nobody is a fan of dripping baby pee and poop or having to wipe up more than necessary.  A pour spout would have been a simple solution to this problem.Otherwise, we are completely pleased with this product.  I can imagine having a second one for the car down the line might be a good investment considering how reasonably priced it is.Update: We still use this now that our daughter is five months old.  We saw that Ikea has a $5 potty, so we got one to have a secondary use potty.  I hate to say it, but Ikea perfected the \"spout\" design to cleanly pour out waste.  The Ikea potty is bigger and the opening is wider, so we have to be more careful about her backside falling in and it appears to be a bit more uncomfortable for smaller babies.  For that reason, I still prefer the size and shape of the Baby Bjorn potty.

There is an anti slip rubber on the bottom so no worries about pottying children ending up somewhere else than where you left them.My twins are now potty trained, but I still keep one in the back of the van for emergencies.

Hook", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "For nearly a year, I have been struggling to help my now three-year-old become potty trained.  We have tried four other potty seats, and all have proved difficult to use:-We first tried the Primo Ducka toilet seat (looks like a duck), and while it was cute and engaging, he could not climb on the toilet to use it by himself, and it often directed the liquid flow right between the toilet and seat (what a mess!).-Next, we used an old-fashioned wooden potty chair (the kind with a high back and arm rests), but this had a separate plastic guard that hurt my son and also allowed liquid to leak.-The third potty chair we tried was the Baby Bjorn Little Potty, which slid too easily on our bathroom floor, was too low to the ground, and always allowed liquid to drip along the outside when tipped in the toilet during cleaning.-My son did enjoy the next potty - a \"Peter Potty\" toddler urinal.  It was great fun to stand like Daddy, and it even had a water tank so that it could be \"flushed\" like a real potty.  After several months, however, the top water tank started dripping often, and the bottom reservoir was so hard to pull out that when it finally let loose, liquid sloshed out!Frustrated, I set out to scour Amazon for one final shot at a potty that would work for my son and would be easy to clean.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided upon the Baby Bjorn potty chair, allowed my son to be involved by selecting a color (blue)...and couldn't be happier with our choice!My son has been excited about his new blue Baby Bjorn potty chair since the UPS driver brought it to our house, and I am impressed as well.  This potty chair is tall enough that it is comfortable for him to sit upon, there are no separate guards that pinch him, the rubber bottom prevents it from sliding on our floor, it has a back and armrests that help my son stand up after going potty, he can use it by himself, AND it's super easy to clean!  I have found that if you pour the liquid out the back of the potty chair insert (where the white bowl curves upward), the liquid does not run down the outside of the container like other potty chairs.Overall, while a bit pricey, this is without a doubt the best potty chair we have found for our toddler boy.

With our first, we had 3 in diapers, giving us MAJOR motivation to get him potty trained, so we tried almost every seat out there.  Most of them were okay, but just got nasty quckly, were hard to disinfect, or were uncomfortable for my son.  The ones with the removable splash gaurd are not gentle and can scrape a child's sensitive parts.  Those were awful.  We were \"potty training\" for a full year before we finally saw the BabyBjorn potty chair in a local botique, and DS immediately sat in it.  He chose blue, and we took it home.  Within a week, he was trained, and began using the \"big boy seat\", so we saved the seat for our daughter.  It was incredable!  Now our 23 month old daughter is training.  We bought her this white babybjorn seat for our downstairs bathroom, with the blue upstairs.  She has been \"training\" for 6 days now, and is almost completely day trained!This seat is by far the best in our experiences.  Here's why:  1. the seat has a higher back and sides, which gives the child support while sitting down, standing up, or simply sitting there.  2. It is NOT easy to tip! several of the others we tried tipped without much effort when our child was putting pressure on the sides trying to sit down or stand.  3. It is super easy to clean - there aren't a bunch of seams to gather gunk, it's easy to wipe down with a clorox wipe and be done.  It's also super easy to take the little bucket out, and soak in clorox or hose down.  4. Kids can choose what color they want!  This was such a big deal to my children --- also, they are solid colors that can look nice with your bathroom.  The surface is also nice that your child can decorate the back with cute stickers if wanted.  5. It works for children of all different sizes!  My son was 40\" and 42lbs when potty training, and my daughter is 25lbs and a little shrimp, and this seat fit them both WONDERFULLY.Overall, having tried MANY seats, this one was the absolute best for both our children, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone in need of a seat for potty training success~!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The MOST SUCCESS of them all!", "unixReviewTime": 1122249600, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2005"}

Also, he usually needs help getting on it. He's just shy of 3' tall and weighs about 28lbs. He doesn't think he can just sit down on this one because of the splash guard (which is what prevents the mess) and waits to be helped. With the PottyPOD he just sits right down and then scoots to the best position.It does live up to most of the claims -- it doesn't move around, even when he is not sitting calmly; it is easy to clean; the high back is nice (though again, my son seems to scrunch forward when on this potty, which I think has to do with the high back); the design is essentially innocuous and not out of place in an adult bathroom (ours is in the main floor powder room, the only bathroom a guests use, so this is important).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "So-So potty chair for us", "unixReviewTime": 1382918400, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2013"}

It took me almost 2 weeks of researching different potty's, reading various reviews (good and bad) and then finally deciding on this one. Our little one took to it immediately (not to mention the 10 potty books she had to read helped quite a bit too).Eventually, she would say \"poop\" and we'd rush her to her potty chair. I read many reviews on this one and I took any reported problems that parents had (of both boys and girls) into consideration. I was nervous about her accidentally sitting on the splash guard or watching for her bottom having a red ring after sitting a while or the seat sticking to her bottom whenever she tried standing up and spilling pee everywhere. Honestly, I haven't had any of those issues. Her bottom does have a pink ring on it from the impression of where she was sitting on the potty seat, but it's not like it's sore or that it's an actual bruise. I get one too whenever I use the toilet, so can't really understand why parents complained about that.This is a really good potty seat. It has a rubber bottom edge so it keeps the potty chair in place. It has a tall back support and some armrests which is really nice. The little inner potty cup is easily removed and cleaned instead of needing to pick up the whole thing.I didn't give it 5 stars because the potty chair is kind of short. My daughter is petite and I'm surprised that she's still kind of tall for this.

I have had this chair for about two weeks. I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter.  I also purchased Leslie Patricelli's \"Potty\" book in the same Amazon order. When the box arrived, I took it into my daughter's room (I had already cut through the tape) and we opened it together. She was so excited. We took this right into the bathroom, so she could see. I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the \"Potty\" book is on a stand next to her potty chair. She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I didn't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays. I have been trying to get her to say the words \"potty\", \"poop\", and \"pee\". She hasn't said any of those words yet. However, she is starting to comprehend the words. She loves sitting on this chair and reading her \"Potty\" book. On an even better note, she has peed twice in the past two days, while sitting on her potty chair! I was so impressed!About the chair:It's so perfectly simple! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into. The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard, but it's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated. So far nothing has splashed onto the floor. The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet. The bowl doesn't have anything to lock it into place, so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning. As the description notes, the design is ergonomical and stable. The chair is high, wide, and well-curved. It would be difficult to tip over.On the (barely) downside. The seat is hard plastic and doesn't seem comfy. However, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children don't try to take the bowl out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So happy with this!", "unixReviewTime": 1353110400, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2012"}

Maybe if I had 20 or 30 year old diapers to compare these to, I'd give them a much lower rating.  But I don't.These are absolutely the cheapest way to cloth diaper a baby if you want to buy new diapers.  They're an ultra-basic birdseye cotton.  MANY modern cotton flats are birdseye.  They do indeed appear thin. BUT after a few washes, they are super-soft.  I really cannot over-talk how wonderfully soft they are.  They're a very close second to the flannel receiving blankets I also use as diapers.For comparison, I bought some OsoCozy flats, also sold here on Amazon, back in January.  Those flats are visibly thicker.  After I prepped the OsoCozy diapers, I did a head-to-head comparison.  I put my daughter in an origami-folded Gerber flat, pinned, and kept her coverless until she peed. Then I did the same with the OsoCozy flats--same fold, same pinning, etc and kept her coverless until she peed.  End result?  These are JUST AS GOOD as the more expensive diapers.So, why am I not giving them five stars?  One reason only: size.  Flat diapers are supposed to last your baby from the newborn stage through toilet training.  These really won't.  For all that the product description says they're 27x27, they're not, at least not after being washed.  They are very rectangular after prepping, and pretty small.Their small size makes them PERFECT newborn diapers, though.  Even if most of your stash is all-in-one diapers, you would do well to buy a couple dozen of these for the first couple of months, especially if you tend to have smallish babies (one-size diapers don't usually fit below 8lbs).  They work perfectly for small babies--yes, they even contain breastfed poop!--and once your babe has outgrown their intended use, they are FANTASTIC for stuffing pockets, lining gDiapers (this is my usual use for them these days), and using as doublers for fitted diapers or overnight diapers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "YES these work AS DIAPERS", "unixReviewTime": 1312675200, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2011"}

The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong!!The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at \"Customer Service\" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement.

Also, the new shoulder harnesses really torque the seat sideways, and this thing only makes it worse. I don't like using it with a shoulder harness belt unless it's dead center of the car, because the extra torque tends to make the seat crooked. Finally, getting it to release is kind of a pain. You have to crank the ratchet a partial turn, hold down the yellow lever, and pop a button while holding it down. Doesn't always work on the first try.

We're on our second car seat now, and I've helped install others for friends, and every car seat has its own installation quirks. At some point, with all of them, if you're using seat belts to hold down the car seat, you're going to have to tighten the belt significantly. When I install our car seat (before the Mighty Tite), that means getting up on it and bearing down a lot of weight while tugging on it; when my wife does it, it means not being able to get a really tight fit at all.\"After\" we got the Mighty Tite, and went through the use of it, I'd say our car seat installation time was reduced by 200%, and the installation job was much more secure. During a recent spate of traveling, we had to install and re-install the seat a dozen times in a two-week period, and this was utterly essential for getting on and off of the airplane quickly while still having a securely-installed seat, and even more importantly, getting the seat re-installed securely when we were putting it into a \"strange\" car.We particularly appreciated the plastic instructions attached to the Mighty Tite with a metal ring -- it meant when we got confused about how to use it with a different belt arrangement, we had the visual reference right at hand and not all dog-eared or ripped up (like our car seat installation manual!)Obviously, if you're only going to install the car seat once in one car there may be diminishing returns on a device like this. But if you have to move it even occasionally, I think this accessory is worth the price for a little extra security and peace of mind, plus a few extra minutes saved.The one caveat I provide is that the plastic retainers that hold the strap in have begun to look a little stressed (the way well-used plastic looks before it breaks), so this might not wear well over a multi-year period. This is not a safety issue, since this part is used only to guide the safety belt, and if it does break, it will still be usable. Still, one would hope it will not!

However, while prepping them for first use, they just about RUINED my very expensive Rowenta iron. Why, you ask? Why would the cotton setting NOT work on a cotton breast pad? Because the brainiacs who made them decided to use some sort of nylon-based serger thread on the edging! I started to iron the first one, and my iron began sticking to the pad. I peeled it off the iron, and there, in a perfect circle, were little melted remnant marks from the thread. It is not even polyester thread, which tolerates a VERY high heat (i.e., cotton) setting from an iron.I am so incredibly disappointed. I really wanted to use these because they are cotton. So, off to the drawing board, I will just have to sew my own. And in case you are wondering why I would iron them, they come out of the wash very wrinkly (whether you air dry or put in the dryer; I washed them twice for prepping and did both drying methods). One of my girlfriends said she had tried them and they were very noticeable under her shirt because of the wrinkling, thus, my plan was to iron them smooth after each wash.If you don't mind wrinkles, or are planning on using a padded nursing bra, then I suppose these would work for you...

The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 1/2\" wide and 7-5/8\" long. When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-1/8\" by 1-1/2\".  There are no holes for wall mounting, but four outlet covers, two plastic cable ties, and ten cord identifier stickers are provided.To open the 4\" cover at the power strip cord end, you pull up on a single tab; this seems rather easy for a child to disengage, which means that he/she might have access to the outlet nearest the power strip cord end.  To open the main cover, you pry open three tabs, then open the unit like a clamshell.The plastic is softer but probably more resistant to breakage compared with the Safety 1st model.

I have to say, with all the sleep deprived parents using this item, often in the middle of the night, you would think that Avent would be wise enough to put an auto-shut-off feature on this little doohickey. But, no. I exclusively feed my baby breastmilk, and that stuff is like \"liquid gold\" (from what everyone has told me, and I'm inclined to agree), and I can't even tell you how often I have put a bottle in the warmer to warm it and then forgot it was in there for like 15 minutes. The milk gets boiling hot in that time, and then it's useless and I have to pour it out because it's not supposed to be heated to boiling. I know people are probably going to read this and wonder how one could forget that they put a bottle in the warmer, but now that our baby is sleeping through the night, it's more for when my husband is giving her a bath, I will get the bottle ready for him as he gives her a bottle after her bath and puts her to bed (his time with her during the week). So many times I have forgotten it was in there and burned the milk, but also - and this is the really dangerous part - the light will shut off for like 30 seconds at a time (what they call \"blinking\", if you can believe that), and so often it will look like it's turned off when there is no bottle in it, but it isn't, and it will just keep heating the water in there until it's all gone. We have found it on after a couple of hours away from it because we didn't notice the \"blinking\" light because it was off at the time, and there is no other indication that it's on from the front. The switch is on the back and it's not clearly marked \"on/off\" either. I can't imagine how it hasn't caught fire for other people or melted the plastic when the water is all gone. Thankfully, I have noticed it before the water was completely gone, but it was almost gone. How unsafe! Anyway, I still use it because I haven't found one with an auto-off feature, but will be looking for one.

We also learned that the prescription only formula he now has to have tastes digusting when not kept very warm.Hence our decision to purchase the Avent bottle warmer.

It services all types of containers, and of differing sizes too. It can warm disposable, oversized, and odd shaped bottles, glass babyfood jars, and tin cans to name a few. It's small in size, measuring 5\" x 5\" x 5 \" high. Thus, it occupies very little room on the counter, or bedside table. A plastic basket fits on the inside of the warmer, and is removable for larger items. On the front of the unit is a dial control. It has 3 settings, 1,2, and 3, 1 being the coolest. Next to the dial is a power light, which serves 2 purposes.1.) It indicates the unit is \"ON\" and working, and2.) When the water reaches the correct temperature, the power light blinks \"ON\" and \"OFF\" to indicate the water is ready.There is NO ON/OFF switch on this bottle warmer. For that reason, one must unplug it after each use. With a rather lengthy cord, 3 feet long, it is very adaptable. For those concerned about d&eacute;cor, the all white exterior is designed to blend in. In addition, the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is portable. By that, I mean it's lightweight; it weighs 1 pound, and is compact enough to fit in an overnight bag. We traveled frequently when William was an infant, and this unit made a nifty travel companion.Pros* Accommodates all brands of bottles* Heats fast and evenly* Compact and lightweight* It's durable* Heats bottle liners without melting the plastic* The basket can be removed to warm oversized bottles, i.e. Avent Magic cup* Grounded 3-prong conductorCons* Overheats* No ON/OFF switch* An internal thermostat and an external timer would greatly improve this productMy Experience:Right off the bat, I was heating 10 bottles of breastmilk a day, as I was unable to breastfeed. Thus, I was thrilled to have a bottle warmer. Pop a bottle in the unit; plug it in, and in 5 minutes it's done. How difficult is that? The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer heats fast, evenly, and it's durable. Moreover, now there's no more white, icky, stuff to clean off my pans.In all the time I used this bottle warmer, I never encountered any problems. Let me tell you, this unit got a workout in my house. I think my success was actually due to reading the instruction manual. I know ~ \"geek alert\". Okay, that's true, but it's also fair to say that I quickly learned to keep a timer when warming. I overheated many bottles in the months I served warm milk, because I'd get distracted. Consequently, running a timer became apart of the routine. If Avent were to add an external timer, this would be extremely helpful to users. I almost never used the coolest setting, only when thawing frozen breastmilk, and I only used the 2nd setting when warming disposable bottles. Both were rare occasions. I generally thawed breastmilk in the refrigerator, and I used disposable bottles when I was on the go ~ outside the house.Here's another tip, adding an internal thermostat with an automatic shut off feature would seriously improve this product. Many have complained about the lack of an ON/OFF switch. I kept the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer on the kitchen counter so the lack of an ON/OFF switch was never an issue. Had I kept it at my bedside this would have been a huge inconvenience; although, a power strip would solve that problem. Whether one turns off a switch or unplugs the unit either way this final step must be completed. I can NOT tell you how many times I forgot to unplug this bottle warmer. An hour might go by before I realized my mistake. Now that's a fire hazard!Closing Remarks:When it comes to bottles, Avent is still my 1st choice. I have learned through research that several manufactures have modified their bottle warmers to accommodate the Avent brand. I guess that goes to show... input from customers can, and does influence manufactures. Avent could make a few improvements to this bottle warmer, which would certainly increase the price. However, I for one would be willing to pay for those added features. Would you? While writing this review, I've debated how to rate this product. I was extremely pleased with this warmer, but I also recognize its shortcomings. I've opted to give this product an above average mark, because1.) It did what it was supposed to do. It warms bottles fast, and evenly.2.) It accommodates plastic, glass, tin, and a myraid of bottles styles.3.) Warms disposable bottles, and bottle liners, and4.) It saved me from the stovetop hassles.Happy Feeding,Mary", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer  does the job!", "unixReviewTime": 996019200, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2001"}

It uses a coil to heat and I've heard that these type of heating mechanisms should be unplugged when not in use so that they won't get ruined, but there is an ON/OFF switch on the back of the warmer if you'd rather just use that.

(i.e no exersaucer to babysit, not bouncers, no ridiculous toys, no uneeded baby products, and yeah, no sterelizer). Well my husband said we needed most of the stuff I said we didnt. But he let me be stuborn and didnt purchase the sterelizer. Well after 2 1/2 years of boiling bottles, pacifiers, teethers and all that other stuff, I was going crazy. Yet I still wouldnt admit it to my husband :). When the second set of twins were on the way, I was ready. I was going to buy baby wipes warmers, exersaucers, bouncers, swings, the aquarium crib soother and this sterelizer. Well this sterelizer is my hero (as well as my husband who forced me to get one!). It cleans about 6 bottles and all of the things that come with them. (actually it cleans 5 of the playtex airvent ones, but I use avent too). I did breast feed so it also cleans avent pumps (and my friend managed to get another kind in one!). My kids love pacifires so those are constantly in there, and so are all those teething rings. Let me just tell you that you can NOT put a dirty item in here, you still have to wash it a bit. This just makes sure its really clean, (my kids have maybe been sick 5-6 times, all four of them put together!) This sterelizer is great, and it uses very little water (I have a purifier so I use pure water). like another reviewer I HIGHLY RECOMEND TO UNPLUG IT WHEN NOT IN USE! I will say it again, after boiling bottles and sippy cups and pacifires and teethers all night, REGISTER FOR THIS! ITs a bit pricey but I can gaurentee that replacements for the bottles that you disintigrated while boiling and sleeping at the same time, and doctor visits and medicine for those odd illnesses due to unsanitary things that your child(ren) place in their mouth, will cost you more!*** P.S...

I bought the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer to save time, and money.  After a brief, and horrible stint with stovetop sterilizing, I began to use the dishwasher to clean my son&#65533;s bottles.  Oh, and I mean USE.  Sometimes I ran the dishwasher 3-times a day JUST to clean bottles.  I live in the desert, where water is precious.  We pay handsomely for every drop that passes through our pipes.  When I saw this sterilizer sitting on the shelf at Target, I snagged it.1.) It requires a small amount of water, and2.) It sanitizes in less than 10-minutes.I thought to myself, &#65533;How can I go wrong?&#65533;This appliance is user friendly, so to speak.1.) There is NO way to confuse the stacking order: the base, the bottle rack, and the lid.  There is no other way to put the thing together.2.) Loading can be confusing if the instructions are not followed.  Keep the manual handy, as the loading order for large bottles, differs from the 4-ounce size.3.) Add the proper amount of water to the base every time.  Do not skimp on the water, as it could cause the unit to burn.  Do not over-fill it either, as the unit may not produce enough steam to work.That said ~ it&#65533;s really quite simple to use.  Pour 7-ounces of water in the base, load the rack, and pop it in the microwave.  In 4 or 5-minutes it&#65533;s done.  Of course, it depends on the wattage of your microwave.  Smaller microwaves may require more time, but that&#65533;s all there is to it.  I learned the hard way to wait before taking the sterilizer out of the microwave.  It&#65533;s HOT!  VERY hot!  Plus, any steam that&#65533;s emitted can burn.  The contents inside the unit will remain sterile for up to 3-hours given that the lid remains closed.  Once the cooling time has passed, 2-minutes or so, remove the lid carefully.  There will be lots of condensation on the bottles, similar to the dishwasher before the drying cycle begins.  Place all the bits and pieces on a drying rack, or hand-dry them.When my son was a newborn, I used the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer at least 4-times a day.  I cleaned bottles, nipples, breast pump parts, and pacifiers.  Later on, I used the sterilizer on some of his toys.  Be careful, not all toys are dishwasher safe.  If it&#65533;s top-drawer dishwasher safe, than it&#65533;s probably sterilizer safe.  We took many trips when William was an infant, and this unit made traveling easy.  It provided a safe place to store the breast pump, and it worked in every hotel microwave we encountered.  I don&#65533;t recall exactly when I stopped using the sterilizer.  It was probably soon after Will started solid foods.  At any rate, this sterilizer was seriously tested in our home.  I never had any problems, except the occasional burn to my hand when I opened the lid too early.  Bad mommy, bad!I can safely say the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer was worth its weight in gold.  Some might complain about the price of the sterilizer, but considering two, 9-ounce bottles come with the unit, it may seem more reasonable knowing they retail for $4.00 a piece. The EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer turned out to be one of the BEST purchases I made the year my son was born, and I will happily recommend it to anyone.Happy Feeding,Mary :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just Nuke it with the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer", "unixReviewTime": 996019200, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2001"}

The first is the SCF271/07 (ASIN B001C3KXPG) and the second is the SCF271/02 (ASIN B000056OUH).  BOTH actually contain the basic Express II Microwave Steam Sterilizer which holds up to six (6) bottles or a combination of other items including microwaveable breast pumps, cups, etc.The only difference is that the SCF271/02 contains an ADDITIONAL two (2) of the 9oz/260ml  Airflex Natural Feeding Bottle and Nippple.Strangely enough as of this writing, Amazon is selling the SCF271/02 (the one that contains two extra feeding bottles) for a much lower price than the SCF271/07.  So until prices remain like this, know what you are buying and consider it a bonus to have the two extra bottles.TO STERILIZE OR NOT TO STERILIZE...WITH THIS MICROWAVE STERILIZER:The argument is not whether you should sterilize your baby products (or expose the baby to germs as argument in strengthening the immune system) because if you're searching for a sterilizer and reached this page, then I'm going to assume you agree with the sterilization process.The other argument in question is whether you are content with using hot running water and anti-bacterial soap or running a dishwasher and if these steps alone are enough to sterilize.  Well it doesn't help to take an extra step to go thru a short few minutes in the microwave.  Again, if you're in this page then you've come to accept that this sterilization process is worth the extra caution.HOW MANY MINUTES IN THE MICROWAVE AT FULL POWER AND 200ml OF WATER?2 MINUTES @ 1,100 - 1,850W, 2 MINUTES COOLDOWN4 MINUTES @ 850 - 1,000W, 2 MINUTES COOLDOWN6 MINUTES @ 500 - 800W, 2 MINUTES COOLDOWNI'm restating these from the manual because it's important to ensure proper use.  Too little water and you can end up damaging the sterilizer.  Too much water and you fail to properly sterilize.Check to see the wattage of your microwave.  The model number is usually a giveaway on this.How much is 200ml?  Your baby bottle should give you that info.Also remember to allow 2 minutes cooling time prior to unlocking the lid unless you want to be greeted with hot steam on your face and second degree burn or worse.HOW LONG WILL IT REMAIN STERILE?The manual further states that the items will remain sterile for 24 hours PROVIDED THE LID IS NOT REMOVED.  So yes you can sterilize in advance and leave it inside until you need it for the day.COMMENTS:Avent and Philips have consistently provided quality plastic products.  The look and feel is what I have come to expect.  It is well made and there are no rough edges or protruding plastic parts that may have not been molded properly.The manual will tell you how to position the items in the sterilizer versus simply dumping them in.  The point of the sterilizer is to allow hot steam to circulate around.  So incorrect position may mean not creating a good sterilization process.When all is said and done, this is a simple sterilizer you put in the microwave.  For the low cost it is offered, it's a small price to pay for extra security for your baby.

I've never had any issues with getting burned or anything melting. And all it takes is 7 oz of water (I use filtered water instead of tap water) that I recycle every 2-3 uses to avoid wasting water(beyond that the water level decreases so it's best to measure to make sure it's still 7 oz).However, I have a gassy baby and wanted to see if I could switch to the Born Free bottles since several of my friends have raved about them. My 1 month old daughter is drinking 4 oz now, so I bought the 9 oz Born Free bottles and unfortunately they do not fit this sterilizer.

We already stocked the diapers, wipes, warmer, etc on the changing table and thought we were ready to go until our instructor at a baby class at the hospital gave us advice on changing our baby.  The instructor said it's a good idea to have everything out and ready when you change your baby, as sometimes they can be hyper or throw a fit.  If you're not ready to change them, the results could be disastrous.  Another tip was to \"have everything should be within arm's reach\", as you will want to place one hand on the baby at all times.Upon learning this, I asked my wife \"isn't there some kind of \"side cart\" for the changing table where you can have the diapers, powder, wipes, lotions, rash paste, etc right there?\"  She said there was, so I looked to Amazon to find it.  On a side note, despite registering for the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer, I've learned that you never get exactly what you register for - especially on your baby registry.  Instead, we got theMunchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer - Greenas a gift.  That warmer itself isn't bad, but the compatible stand (Munchkin Diaper Duty Organizer) isn't what we wanted because it has to sit on a flat surface (like a dresser or table).  Remember I wanted one that hooks on the side of your changing table \"within an arm's reach\"There are other products that hook onto the side of your changing table, such asMunchkin Diaper Change OrganizerandDexbaby Nursery Organizer, Whitekind of fit what i'm looking for, but the \"shell\" is made of cloth.  Cloth makes things flimsy.  I wanted something more rigid and heavy duty.That's when I found the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot.  This thing is awesome.  Per the picture, it's got 2 removeable side compartments to store stuff like bottles, cotton balls, rash cream, etc.  The middle compartment is for diapers that you pull out from a slat at the bottom.  The top part compartment is for baby wipes, which fits your standard wipe case.  Although the Munchkin wipe warmer we own doesn't fit on that top compartment for wipes, it still does everything we need to for everything else.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brilliant Changing Accessory For Babies, Fits Delta Changing Table Perfectly!", "unixReviewTime": 1391472000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2014"}

This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that.

My daugther has always been big for her age, but at age 2.5 and 40\" tall, she is still using and loving this tub. No other hard plastic tubs I've tried fit her beyond a year or so.The primo keeps the water much warmer than a porcelein tub does, which is good in winter- you really notice the difference if you ever have to bathe your toddler in a regular bathtub. You can't put much water in for safety reasons, and then it goes cold fast. The Primo EuroBath solves both of those issues nicely.I like that you can fill it pretty full for older toddlers so they stay warm and get to experience the feeling of a real, splashy bath (with toys) without the safety concerns and slipperyness of an adult tub. We try the big tub from time to time, but at age 2-ish, my daughter is still a bit wobbly, even just sitting in the tub and playing with her toys, and with the big tub being so slippery, the Eurobath feels much more secure for her. At her size, she can't physically slip and get underwater in this tub (without doing a handstand in it or something)!I also like that you can place your child in the saddle seat end or the more open end. Each side has some support, with the toddler end allowing more movement but not as much as just an open plastic tub- the plastic pommel in the center provides a nice barrier to force her to stay seated.And speaking of staying seated: you kind of have to stay seated in this tub- standing up in it is a little awkward, which is good. In the big tub, my daughter constantly wants to stand up to \"just get another toy\" or different soap or whatever. In the Primo tub, she forgets to want to, because it's just not possible or comfortable to try to do so.The only \"con\" of this tub for me is that it's not quite as cushy and comfy as our previous inflatable tubs, and the hollowed out areas in the underside can get water deposit buildup and stains and are awkward to clean, even with the Clorox bleach wipes I bought just for that purpose.Everything else about this tub rocks! I can see us continuing to use it for quite a while longer, until my daughter is a little more mature and can handle the freedom of the big tub.

I've tried other models when watching my friend's kids, nieces and nephews.  Of the ones I've tried I felt that the molded ones don't grow well with the kids, and the ones with padding, foam, or the slings never get as clean as you want them.  I got this one based on the reviews, and none of those things have ever been a problem.It was a little big when my baby was a newborn, but I just lined the reclining end with a small towel (rolled up a bit at the bottom to give her a boost) and it propped her up perfectly.  The grandparents didn't have a baby tub, so I had to bathe her in the sink when visiting.  I dreaded it because I was so spoiled by how easy this tub makes bathtime.  That free hand can be priceless!  I went so far as to bring it on vacation with us (for her and the 2 other babies there) - just packed a bunch of her stuff inside and threw it in the back of the car!  She is a year old now and she still fits just fine.  We lay her back to wash her hair in one end, and when she sits up she can spin herself around to the other end to play.  As a little bonus, now that she is mobile, using this tub keeps her contained.  I am not chasing a slippery toddler up and down the length of a full size bathtub!It is a definitely a big tub compared to other models, but don't let that deter you.  I went to Lowe's and bought one of those giant, locking suction cup hooks.  I stuck it to the top of the tub wall opposite the shower head.  It holds the tub, and we still have plenty of room to shower.  Our mesh tub toy bag hangs neatly out of sight underneath it, and as a bonus the toys aren't soaked every time someone takes a shower.  (The only thing with the suction hook is that if it's not locked down the tub can fall, and when it does it is LOUD!  But - lesson learned - it only takes a second to lock the hook.)I've never used the drain.  She is only a little kid - I don't think she gets so dirty that she needs a whole tub full of fresh water to rinse.  After her bath I just tilt the entire tub up to dump it, wipe it out with one of those Lysol or Clorox disinfecting wipes, rinse it and hang it up.  The only real crevice to clean out is the drain plug. The rest of the surface is smooth so it wipes down quickly.Overall, I feel like this tub is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.

This tub is, hands down, the very best bathtub on the market. We bought this tub before our daughter (first child) was born. We chose it based on the rave reviews of a trusted friend and the advice of NICU nurses in a baby preparation class we took. After 22 months of use, this tub is still in perfect condition and our daughter still fits in it with room to spare. This tub allows you to wash your child with at least one, if not both, hands free. The baby sits in what reminds me of a western-style saddle with the piece in front that won't let baby slip down -- even as a newborn. Our daughter's very first bath was in this tub just the way it's pictured here (no infant insert needed). She'll be 22 months-old next week and still fits in this tub. We expect she'll fit in this tub well past her 2nd birthday. Now THAT'S what I call bang for your buck.We got one of those inflatable duck tubs for our daughter's first birthday as a gift. We blew it up tonight thinking maybe we'd start putting her in the adult tub with the duck since she splashes us a lot now and soaks the walls when we use the eurobath on the bathroom counter top. To our dismay, we found that the duck inflatable tub was way too small. We assume other inflatable tubs will be too per their dimensions. In addition, the duck tub was so narrow that our daughter's bath toys would have been piled up on her lap. In the eurobath, even at nearly two, she still has plenty of room to sit and play with all manner of bath toys. She sits confidently in the eurobath because she's supported so there's no slipping and scaring her, and there's no worry for us. I can wash her hair and her body without holding onto her or worrying she'll slide and bump her head, etc. We'll probably just start putting the eurobath in the adult tub for a while now until she outgrows it.I cannot say enough good about this tub. You WILL NOT find a better tub out there because it just doesn't exist. Other tubs may have \"spa\" features or temperature devices but they don't hold a candle to this tub. You can buy a cheap rubber duckie bath water thermometer at any baby store and they work fine.

I like that and I always put my stuff in these areas before I even start the bath so that everything is right there and I don't have to reach for anything.  Once your baby can sit very well, you move him to the toddler/sitting side.  This side is great because it allows you to bathe the baby and he won't be sliding all around the tub because the moldings help keep him steady and secure. Here is the one warning and tip I will give:  My second son was very active during bath time.  He loved to play and carry on.  He kept on trying to stand and he kept slipping and smashing his little behind and nether regions on the molding.  This happened a few times until I learned that this tub was no longer a good tub for him.  I packed it away and brought it out when my third son was born.

We started using it as soon as my son's cord stump fell off.  Alex *hated* sponge baths, but he loves his Primo tub.  The reclining position is pretty darn safe, and it gives the baby a lot of support while you wash, which is a Godsend.  Alex kicks his feet into the water, but I don't have to worry because he is held up by the raised center bumper and doesn't slip too far into the water.  The depth is perfect, too - the baby doesn't get too chilled.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the drain is very small for the product size, but really, it's not hard to just upend the tub and dump out the bath water once the baby's out.  I also like the indentions to hold the soap and bath products because keeping those in close reach is very handy.

Nothing is even comparable to this Eurobath.  She is having fun in it! and always looking for to bath time.  My daughter is now 13 months and she is about 20 lbs.Below is the comparison of the other bathtubs to Eurobath. With other tubs, I experiences:1. Not much room for her to grow and play in the bathtub.  And the water is just covering her buttock (not even up to her waist).While Eurobath gives her so much room to play and keep her body warm with the water that cover up to her chest.2. Too much curving that is just HARD to clean!  I need to use my toothbrush to clean up certain areas in the tub due to the molding.While Eurobath has a smooth curve that makes my cleaning time a breeze (just wipe it dry and done!).3. The infant sling I have, use a metal that finally got give away to corrossion due to its daily exposure to water for the first 6 months.  So basically it was useless!  And for the other one, it was just too narrow for the infant part.While Eurobath infant section has so much space that even my daughter still fit in there for hairwash.  No need to bother corrosion issues too!4. The toddler section is using a chair that is always too big,  my daughter almost always slipping and I need to hold her with my muscle to avoid her sliding.While Eurobath toddler section is just made ergonomically that holds her position in the water.  So less to no more chance of sliding.5. Yes I am editing ADDING this particular benefits that I noticed lately too:  Have you ever had a problem after soaping your baby's buttock then when it times to rinse by filling up the water to the bath tub, you took your baby out thinking it is well rinsed but yet noticed that the buttom of your baby is STILL soapy?  Well at least I did.The FirstYears and Safety1st that we have only cover up to my daughter's waist: if I want to clean the buttock, I need to basically pull her up to rinse it (and pulling her in those bathtubs are not easy because not too much room and not to mention she is heavy too).While the Eurobath: because it covers close to her chest, I just need to slide her around to clean the buttock.  I let the water do the work (floating/buoyancy). And with so much room, my hand can reach and clean her buttock easily.Well I could rave about this product on and on.

I read the reviews of the Euro bath and added it to my registry. I am so glad I did! From the moment we brought our son home this bath has severed us well. I must confess that I also recieved the summer infant comfy bath sponge and actually the two items complemented each other perfectly. From newborn to about 10 weeks I placed the summer infant bath sponge in the reclining part of the Euro bath. This secures a small baby in the bath, keeps them warm and allows you to reach for things like washcloths and wash without fear of them slipping. Given the low cost of the bath sponge it was a winning combination. As our son has got bigger we've not needed the sponge and at 13 weeks he's now at ease in the reclining part without the sponge. I have been told that some babies don't like water (my little man did wig out once) but I think the Euro bath is a gentle intro to water and bathing.

You need to measure because you will need to figure out where you will use it and store it.  My master bath only has a shower stall, so I use this in there when I bathe my 6 1/2 month old daughter.

It seemed like every couple of months we were buying new baby tubs and then I found this tub.  He used this tub until he was nearly three years old.  I preferred using this tub because for some reason, it seemed like it kept the water warmer than the big bath tub in our main bathroom.  Also, there is nowhere for him to hit his head, which he did on the regular bath tub.  This tub, does hold quite a bit of water, but it even if you fill it completely full, it will only use a fraction of the hot water that the main bath tub in your house will use, so it helps you save on water and water heater costs as well.My daughter is 25&#34; tall and just under 16 lbs and just outgrew the Puj tub that I was using in the bathroom sink.

I do put a hand towel down to keep the little man from sliding (although he still does a little), but for the most part, this tub allows me to use both hands for washing which speeds up the process.  It's also nice to have a drain plug that allows you to adjust the amount of water in the tub if you happen to put too much in.Many people don't like the size of the tub, and it is large.  It will take up the vast majority of a standard size tub (which you also have to keep in mind for storage purposes).  Our bathtub stays in our normal tub unless we have company, then we stash it in the nursery.  It's not pretty, but it works.If you are looking for something collapsible or portable, this is not the tub for you.

The slanted part is such that we still use it to wash my daughter's hair even as a large toddler.

Some reviewers complain about this, but I look at it this way:  we have a tub/shower, and put this bath tub into our bathtub to bathe our daughter.  If I had to scrub out our tub every night to get it clean enough for her, that would be a huge pain!  Given this tub's large size, I can (now that she's too big to ever slip under) fill it up to the top, and she's got warm water and suds up to her mid-chest, without any risk of her falling under as with an adult tub.  To me, this is a much more pleasant bath than sitting in the adult tub as a toddler in only a few inches of water.  If you put more water into an adult tub, we've found our toddler slips around too much and feels insecure, even with a mat.Cleaning this tub is a snap.  No nooks and crannies for gunk to accumulate.  The rubber drain is the only place where we get some mildew, but it pops right out for easy cleaning and reinserts just as easily.  I use a Seventh Generation cleaner with a hydrogen peroxide active ingredient.Durability is fabulous:  We actually never drain the tub with the drain, but lift it and spill the water out.

What will he get into? How will he injure himself? What do we need to do to protect him? Hmmmmmm. It's a tough question and no matter what you do, he'll probably find something you didn't think of. Our toddler has already found a tube of diaper rash creme and spread it all over himself (primarily the face) and over the wood floor and a carpet.Well, we've tried to do some common sense things. For example, our living room has a large fireplace with a raised brick hearth. The edge, and particularly the corners, are sharp and harsh and could cause a good wound if the baby were to fall against them. So we bought this Prince Lionheart Cushiony Fireplace Guard. I installed it in about an hour. It's a one-size-fits-all solution and I was afraid our fireplace was too big. No problem. It took a bit of cutting, but we ended up with about 6 inches of edge left over.We don't like the looks of it, but the baby's safety is of greater importance. The guard is stuck on with some tape from 3M and there are warnings in 10 different languages that they do not guarantee that the glue will do no damage. Hmmmmm. I expect there will be damage when the guard is removed.

But who knows whether the manufacturer has updated the technology or just modernized the housing....Anyway, we already had the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor, but since this was free, we got it to take with us on trips or when we're going to a friend's house for the evening and taking our Pack N Play -- that way, we wouldn't have to unplug and pack our Sony all the time.What's good about this monitor:- Both the transmitter and the receiver can run on AC outlet power OR on a 9-volt battery. This is great if you need to put them somewhere that doesn't have easy outlet access. In contrast, the Sony receiver is portable but the transmitter operates on AC power only.- The receiver is compact and has a belt clip.What's not so good:- The sound is not nearly as clear as our Sony. Listening to it makes me think of what my grandmother says about her hearing aid -- it amplifies all the noises equally, so when there's a good bit of noise in the baby's room (i.e., music playing and heat running), you hear a lot of noise through the monitor. With the Sony, I feel like I can turn it down pretty low and it still picks up the baby's cries well without getting all that background noise.- No lights. Now, maybe if I wasn't using the Sony all the time, I wouldn't be so dependent on the lights. And at night, I guess it's not an issue. But when the baby is napping, I am often washing dishes or running laundry or taking a shower or doing something equally noisy, and in those cases, I really rely on those lights to let me know if the baby is crying. With this monitor, I find myself having to pick it up and hold it to my ear to try to figure out what's going on.Bottom line, if you're willing to spend a little more, you can get a superior product in the Sony Baby Call. Frankly, since the Sony 27-channel model has a rechargeable battery, you'll probably make up the cost difference over time.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "OK as a backup monitor", "unixReviewTime": 1102896000, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2004"}

Poor quality control.As far as the one that did work, here are some more details about why I liked it.We've tried a few monitors. This one had the least static. For us, static is the most important issue. We hate it. We use the baby monitors primarily at night, so that we can hear if the kids wake up in the middle of the night. If the monitors have a lot of static it keeps US from getting to sleep.The next most important issue is unnecessary beeping. Some of the other monitors we've used periodically loose the signal from the baby's room, and then automatically reconnects after a few seconds. Each time they loose the signal they beep loudly to let us know. This always wakes us up. This can happen a dozen or more times each night. No good.

I purchased a fisher price baby monitor from amazon before this one and the unit died on me after 2 months of use! It turned out all the reviewers had problems with the hand unit frying after being plugged in to the socket for too long. Both of ours died after less than a month of use. We borrowed a friends who had only used theirs for a month and that one died too! Not wanting to spend another $100+ on a monitor that was only going to die after 1 month we opted for this baby monitor. Wow what a difference! We shouldn't have been fooled by the price in the first place! This monitor has been used for 4 months and it's still kicking. Here's some PROs/CONs:PROs:1. After 4 months of constant use this monitor shows no sign of dying.2. This is the first monitor we've had that doesn't pick up cell phone static!3. There is VERY little static associated with this monitor.4. We hear our baby clearly and the base unit is 5ft away from the crib and next to our white noise machine.5. Even though you are limited to 2 channels we have never picked up any conversations or other baby monitors.CONs:1. They recommended that the unit be plugged in at all times for optimal use. This means you can't walk around with the monitor. Although I remember the directions saying you can use it when it's not plugged in. We just don't use it that way because we keep the monitor in one place in the house.2. You only have one hand unit. Not a problem for us but it might be for others.3. You can only use 2 channels. I put this under both pro's and con's because while it's not an issue for us, it may be for other consumers.Bottom line is, I would buy this monitor again in a heart beat and wish I had purchased it in the first place.

We switched to glass shortly after the news broke.The Evenflo glass bottles are certainly a great buy -- the price is fantastic! I wasn't wild about the rubber nipples that came with the bottles, but I just pitched them and used the nipples we'd been using. (Just about any standard-size, as opposed to wide, nipple will fit these bottles.) I also feel like glass just gets \"cleaner\" than plastic ... that's probably not true, but the glass doesn't get scratched and cloudy like plastic, so the bottles seem more pristine to me!Of course, the best part about glass bottles is that glass is inert. So there are pretty much zero worries about anything leaching into the milk (or formula).Now, the downside ... these suckers are HEAVY! We almost never used the larger bottles, because when filled, they just weighed a ton. And if you've never been smacked in the face with a bottle by a toddler ... well, let's just say these ones are way more painful than the plastic ones!And, unsurprisingly, glass can break. These are quite solid, though, and I think we only ever broke two -- one at home (it was dropped on a hardwood floor) and one at an airport (my son threw it onto a chair with a metal arm ... whoops!).Since my son is no longer drinking anything from bottles except a little water at bedtime, we've switched to BPA-free plastic, just for convenience (and this co-sleeping family's safety!).

BOTTLE NIPPLES give baby CONSTANT FLOW, whether they're sucking or not. On the breast, however, baby has nearly full control of how much and how fast milk comes out. It's why the Ameda breast pump (Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump) gives you a 'Cycle' option. You start out fast - just as your baby does when they first latch on - to allow for the milk let-down. Then, you switch to a slower cycle motion to get the most milk out - just as your baby would once they started feeding. On a bottle nipple, if baby starts fast, of course they're going to have issues at first, until they slow down their sucking motion.I regret buying the MAM bottles (MAM 3-Pack BPA Free Bottle, Boy, 5 Ounce) after I learned how easy the Avent bottles are. The MAM bottles work as intended, but are unnecessarily troublesome. When it came time to send my baby to day care for my return to work, I discovered just how frustrating the MAM bottles are. First of all, you have to make sure the bottom is screwed on **REALLY** tight, otherwise the water used to heat will mix with the contents of the bottle. This turns into such a pain - literally - when it comes time to take the bottle apart for washing. This extra thick, screw-on bottom makes warming the contents extra long compared to other bottles, such as Avent. Once you finally do get the milk warmed and take the MAM bottle out of the hot water, you have to be very careful not to burn yourself or your baby with the steaming water that collected in that screw-on bottom through the vent holes. Banging it out doesn't get all of it and makes too much noise for all those night time feedings or anytime for that matter. Using a wash or burp cloth to protect yourself and baby is yet another added hassle and one more thing to maneuver while trying to feed the baby.None of these issues exist with the Avent bottles. An extra ring is nothing compared to the base parts of the MAM bottles. Popping the lid on and off the Avent bottles is also another easy thing compared to MAM. When you're juggling a crying baby and a bottle at once, it's not convenient to have to use a counter edge to pop off a bottle's lid, but it's something I've had to resort to, unfortunately. Avent's lids are secure enough and prevent leaking without requiring a 2-hand operation.As an added bonus, Avent has a conversion kit that allows me to pump using my Ameda Purely Yours electric breast pump directly into any Avent bottle.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I REGRET BUYING MAM BOTTLES", "unixReviewTime": 1329955200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012"}

We didn't have the same problem with the other sizes, which lasted the full three months that Philips says they would. (I guess they can last longer, but it is recommended you replace them every three months.) Basically, I think the four holes make the top of the nipple weaker, and it leads to it splitting wide open. Our kids's ability to *really* eat, and the fact that he has some teeth coming in, are probably contributing factors, but some of these nipples have lasted only a few weeks which leads me to believe it's an issue with the design.We're going to stick with this size, since our baby was getting frustrated with the slowness of the three-hole version, but will have to keep a close eye on the nipples to make sure they're not breaking and giving him too much milk at once.

I haven't seen them in stores and I was a little hesitant to buy but the good reviews were hard to resist.  My doctor said I could start my daughter on rice cereal at 4 months.  Spoon feeding was NOT cutting it.  I had heard of people putting holes in the nipples of bottles to allow the rice cereal to move through, but you run the chance that you can't control the flow.  So I purchased these and replaced the nipple that comes with the bottle.  LOVE IT!  She is no longer wanting to eat every 2 hours.  She also is actually NAPPING longer.  I know it's a myth but I have noticed a slight difference!A few things you MUST remember when using rice cereal1) Experience shows mixing rice cereal with breastmilk you will have a thinner mix.  As it sits gets thinner.  Formula allows for a thicker mixture.2) If your baby can't handle the flow of the liquid, don't blame the nipple or the bottle.  Blame the thickness of the mixture.  Add more rice to thicken to slow down the flow.  Rule of thumb is 1 TBSP of cereal for 4 oz of BM/Formula.  Now remember # 1 above, BM is thinner!3) Avent bottles:  Biggest complaint is leaking.  Have I had this happen to me?  Yes.  Have I fixed it?  Yes.  If you look at the nipple, there is a small seal at the lip of the nipple which is what PREVENTS leaking.If you're bottle is leaking?  Unscrew and try again.  Test it by shaking the bottle over the sink (this saves you from messy babies!).If it STILL leaks, then I suggest you need to replace the nipple and/or a new bottle screw ring.Great thing I just found was these bottles?Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Bottles, Pink, 3 PackThere is an extra valve ring to help seal.If any of my bottles leak, I follow the steps above.  Never had it leak twice in a row on me.  I have used Avent bottles with my son (2) and my daughter (4 months).  With him I got frustrated about the leaking UNTIL I found someone else's review sharing this information.  Please keep it in mind.  As with all products, there can be \"user\" error at times.  I am sure some leaking is the actual bottles fault, defects do happen.Also, why Avent?  You can convert the bottles to a sippy cup with ease.  LOVE THAT FEATURE!I don't use Avent bottles for \"newborns\" until like 1-2 months old (also I have established breastfeeding on both my children) so I can't speak to the size 1 flow nipple until that time period.  I love the playtex dropins bit more expensive overall but I have NEVER had a leak, plus clean up is a snap if you are a VERY busy mom like myself!Best of luck on bottle feeding!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Make sure you utilized properly!", "unixReviewTime": 1315008000, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2011"}

Beware, there are still quite a few draw-backs.  The first one is that it's difficult to install.  You twist and twist and twist all four of the touch points, and if you don't do it just right, the gate will be wonky or pop out of the wall.  My son has pulled it down several times because I cranked and cranked, but I still didn't get it quite tight enough.  Also, the two touch points on the bottom for some reason fall out of the gate when it's not installed, so if you're storing this gate or not using it all the time, it's super easy for one of those things to fall out in a closet or something, a toddler to walk off with them, and then never see them again, and then your gate is wonkier than ever.  This gate does not work at the bottom or top of stairwells well at all, but is pretty decent in standard doorways.  With stairs, it's difficult to get it level and tight between a banister and a wall, especially because banisters don't have a lot of flat space for the touch points, and secondly the step pedal often ends up not on a step, and so when you step on it, it can pull the gate down again!

My 2 gates arrived in one day with prime shipping!This really is the best doorway gate you can buy.  Very sturdy, easy to install, even comes with a wrench!  I have had several other gates (ones I bought and hand-me-downs) and this is by far the best because 1)it stays open when you don't need it (like when kids are napping) - i used to have to tie my other one open!  2)It is also nearly impossible for a toddler to get through because you need downward weight to open it.  3) Other tension gates I have (dreambaby extra wide gate) worked fine, but it was really tough to get it just right so that both parts latched/locked correctly without being so tight that it wouldn't latch.  This one was a breeze, as long as it is tight, it works, latching perfectly in both places.I have the older version of this gate and it is much better than the newer version.  It had an actual knee plate and it had a wide, sloped base which seems to provide more stability and prevented toes from kicking into the base.  The Amazon photo is incorrect and one of the pics shows the older version, which they do not seem to make anymore.

We did tons of research and finally settled on this one.  We couldn't be happier with our pick!  It is extremely sturdy, doesn't move in the slightest (and we use it ALL day long), and is well built.  The hands-free option is an absolute must if you're getting this because you have small children.  I can step on the release and nudge the gate open with my knee, so my hands are still securely on my child in my arms.  I cannot imagine a child being able to open it because it does take quite a bit of pressure, in fact, our two year tries to step on it and can't budge it.  The gate swings nicely in both directions and easily latches back in place.  I don't especially like that the bar is underneath, but I also understand that there's no way around it.  I will say that at least the designers tried to alleviate the annoyance of the bar by adding in slopping plastic mounds around the bar.  They're not great but definitely better than just the bar.  We also had to get the extension and it works great.  Like other reviewers, I should mention that when you order the extension it's only ONE extension (I think about 5 inches or so), not two separate extensions, which is a little misleading in the description.  We were right on the edge of needing another extension but it actually works great with just the one.  Also, when you pull it out of the box it appears be bent, but it's made that way and it works once it's in.  It's also easy to assemble and install.  I highly recommend this gate!

I recently moved it to a doorway and spent just 15 minutes (since I am now an experienced baby gate installer).  It is tension mounted with no hardware or tools required.  It does come with a little plastic wrench, which is useful for the final tightening once you have the gate in place. It does take quite a bit of elbow grease as well.I expected the gate to swing closed more easily. You have to stop and use your hand, foot, or knee to push it all the way closed - at least on mine. I do find myself using my hands most the time to make sure it's closed, but if I do have my arms full it can definitely be operated without my hands.My baby girl is 8 months old and spends a lot of time standing at the gate (and pulling on it).  I like that if she has her hands on the gate, there is nowhere for her fingers to get pinched as I open it.  Well, there is one place she could; if she ever messed with the foot pedal near the bar that it's connected to.  I have found that if I get my foot too close to that bar when operating the foot pedal, I get a good pinch.I am using the gate in a doorway and the door is able to close normally.  The braces come off the doorjamb just ever so slightly, but it is still secure.I have also used it in a hallway with one extension. In the hall, the top two braces were affixed on the wall, and the bottom two on floorboards, which come out about 1/2\" and I still got a secure fit. The hall is 38\" and one extension did the trick, but the extensions are about $16 so it could get expensive if you needed to make it wider.  The manufacturer recommends only going up to 44\".

Just make sure you use the instructions to install it so you have the correct tightness for the latch (they provide a wrench that takes out the guesswork).The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the width. Many models go wider and you have to purchase an extension for larger openings (i.e. our \"I thought, standard\" hallway). Because it fits smaller openings, it makes for a very narrow gate.

We were concerned at first if the extra extensions would be able to support the three babies sufficiently. It does! The only downfall, which I've seen mentioned a few times before, is that the available width space doesn't match up with what the gate says it can support. So if you get this and are running to the border of width, add that extra extension for sure so it's not wobbling. And after measuring and you think using the gate with both extentions will just barely fit, try it, but more than likely it will be wobbly a bit. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise, this is a great gate! We have the added baseboards along the bottom of our walls plus the tiny toe boards and because this is all pressure mounted it adjusts great. Just take your time and get things even and straight. It doesn't take long to set up, 15-20 minutes tops. It works great for us since we live in military base housing and want to avoid putting holes in the walls to fill in later.

Jordan", "helpful": [389, 394], "reviewText": "After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this wasn't my favorite - but is still a good gate.  I just preferred some of the features of the others.  If it had a wider gate opening, I would have given it a 5 star rating.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates.I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for. The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and 2) the latch mechanismFirst Years - Hands-Free Gate-----------------------------cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32\" Tall / fits 29\"-34\" doorway width / 1.5\" bar to step over / gate opening 17\"- My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17\" wide! I'm 5'8\" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However...- The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width.- Good height to the gate.- It was very sturdy in my doorway.- This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor.- Fits only up to 34\" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension.-  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one.Kidco Center Gateway:---------------------cost $85 & extensions $24 / gate is 29.5\" Tall / fits 29.25\" to 37.5\" doorway width / 1\" bar to step over / gate opening 22\"- Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22\". (This certainly won points from my 6'2\" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others). I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature.- This one also had the most secure latch feature. You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru. I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out.- This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75\" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75\" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become \"weaker\" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37\" and your door opening is 36.5\", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34\").-  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white.-  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1\" high (seems less of a tripping risk).-  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 8/04)-  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need.-  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up.-  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller.-  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it!Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate---------------------------------------------cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36\" Tall / fits 28\"-48\" doorway width / 2\" bar to step over / gate opening 19\"-  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal.-  The gate opening is about 19\" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider.-  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it.-  It does come with its own extensions in 5\" and 10\" so it more easily fits the wider doorways.-  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33\" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5\" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75\" as needed).- It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far. I also just like the way the taller gate looks.- It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2\".- If if fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money.All three gates seemed to:- Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly.- Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall.- Were pretty easy to set up.- All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look \"cheaper\" to me than the others.Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.  Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value.

It combines the security of a permanent mount with the relative ease of installation and occasional portability of pressure-mounted models.I had two irregular doorways to fill in with child gates so our scootching 13-month old could play safely in the area. For one large opening I used the SuperYard Gate, which is a decent all-plastic telescoping gate with permanent-mounting rails, and for the other I used the First Years hands-free with a single extension. After seeing how secure the First Years was, and how incredibly east it was to install the extensions, even though I'm happy with the SuperYard Gate, I wish I had bought two First Years Hands-Free,The operation is really cool -- you step on a pedal, and knee the thing open. It works in both directions! I was skeptical the pedal was baby-proof, but letting my son (who is the median weight of a two and a half year old) put his full weight on it didn't budge it a bit.  The design is also very attractive; nice thin white metal instead of the usual lattice-work plastic on most gates.One comment on an earlier negative review, where the Grandparent indicated their 15-month-old could pull up the foot pedal: this cannot open the gate if the top is properly tightened! (See below). I tried this, and the pedal will slide but not allow the gate to open if the top is tight.I have only a few minor caveats to convey:- when installing it, make sure you follow the instructions and use the little plastic wrench (included) to do some fine-tuning tightening, so that the upper latch is the required distance from the catch (a wrench-width). This is easy to do, and I found that when I tightened it up as the instructions indicated, the good fit of the latch became excellent even with a slightly-irregular-from-vertical door post.- the opening might be a little narrow compared to some other gates; it took a bump or two on my calf to get the hang of, nothing terribly difficult or painful.- the extension might not be necessary if you have an opening that's right on the cusp of the suggested 29-34\" door opening; if you  have an opening right around the maximum, I'd recommend installing it without the extension first to avoid having to make a return for a possible un-needed extension. Installing and de-installing the extension, as I noted, is a piece of cake.- this is not \"portable\" the way a simpler gate is, but can be de-installed and re-installed in less than two minutes. Since it swings open, if you want to use the gate in only one location, the portability isn't an issue.All in all, just about the coolest gate I've used.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I Cannot Believe What a Good Gate this is...!", "unixReviewTime": 1110412800, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2005"}

It seems to be a pretty solid construction, and for a tension gate, it actually holds pretty well.  Not only does this gate confine pets and babies/toddlers/little kids, it seems to be adult-proof, too.  Every single adult that has come into my house has hesitated at this gate because they couldn't figure it out.  HA!There are definitely some downsides to it, but it has been serving us well as a dog and baby gate for close to two years now.Pros:- Hands-free opening- Clean, simple, solid design- Ability to add extenders which work great for wide hallways (I use one on each side of the gate)- Tension-mount system so it's movable and you don't have to put holes in your walls.Cons:- Beware if you have painted your walls recently (Recent for us was maybe a few months prior).  The rubber grip pads just ripped the paint right off when I released the tension in the holding rods.  I'm not sure if the paint on our walls is cheap or if it's because there are just too many layers of paint or what, but I ripped a large chunk out of the wall upon moving the gate.  So yeah, having to patch that sort of defeated the purpose of avoiding a gate that required mounting hardware.- Pedal can get \"stuck\" and become temperamental.  I think this also causes problems with closing.  You should be able to close this easily by just pushing the gate back, but it always sticks in one of the directions and requires more care to close it properly.- I don't know how, but my now almost 21 month-old has managed to open this gate maybe 10 times by now.  She refuses to tell me how and every time I try to watch her try, she acts all helpless and can't open it.

Not their safety so much as my sanity.  We have an old house with the cut glass doorknobs and the door knob thingies are hit or miss on them.  So this gate seemed like the perfect idea.  It's sturdy and attractive, easy enough to open even if your arms are full of toys, laundry, children...  but not so easy my girls were able to figure it out (again, we only had it 9 days though!).  It's pressure mounted but it held up quite well to my girls shaking it in protest.The problem is with our baseboards...  and I think most people have baseboards like this so it seems like a huge design flaw.  We have really wide 6\" baseboards (not common) but at the bottom of that is a bit of round molding, maybe an inch, inch and a half high - and this is where the problem came in - and don't most houses have this??  What happened is the little pressure-mounted pads to hold the gate in place had to sit above these moldings, leaving a gap beneath the gate.  My husband slid a block of wood beneath this gap (actually one our window props, gotta love old houses!) which seemed to fill the gap nicely...  until today...  when I went to open the gate, the wood went flying out, the gate slid down, the pressure pad stayed in place...  so the bolt that adjusts the pad bent, and now the whole top of the gate seems cockeyed.  Not sure yet if I can fix it - I can't figure out exactly where the issue is.This gate seemed like a good idea...  but you need to find a way to fill in the gap underneath, or else it will creep down over time as you push the pedal, and the whole thing will pop out like mine did.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it will work awesome if you don't have those moldings, and if you can think of a good way to fill the gap if you do (I'm thinking maybe zip-tying the wood to the base?) - it will work great  But it seems like something they should have thought of when they made the gate.edited - we got the gate working again, with a block of wood beneath it.  I noticed in someone's \"add your own picture\" picture they mentioned cutting the molding to make the gate fit.  You should not have to cut your wood work!!!

We bought two of them and they were relatively easy to install and had been very effective at keeping our rambunctious 2 year old out of the kitchen and hallway.  The foot petal requires quite a bit of pressure, and even kept our 6-yr old nephew contained pretty well :)That being said -- their reliability over time is *horrendous*.  These gates come with only a 90-day warranty, and both gates started breaking in obviously flawed ways within 6-months.  The first gate stopped locking shut -- which is obviously a problem for a gate that is supposed to keep a 2 year old out of places.  The problem is that the spring-loaded plastic peg can actually separate from the spring inside the end of the swinging door.  I contacted the manufacturer and their customer support was very good!  They shipped out two replacement pegs and I was able to get the door working within a few days.  That being said -- the issue will certainly happen again, as there is nothing preventing the spring from separating.  This is a clear design flaw.Weeks later our second gate broke.  This time the foot petal stopped actuating the pin, so the door will not open.  After taking off the plastic assembly for the foot petal, I found that the metal pin which connects the plastic petal to the metal arm was completely broken (in two places).  After putting the pieces together, the issue became very clear -- the metal pin is tapered quite substantially in two places -- which is exactly where the pin broke.  With people putting significant force on the foot petal to open the gate -- dozens of times a day -- is really unacceptable to have such an obvious weak point in the design of the metal pin.The problem with the pin being broken is that there's clearly no way to actually reassemble the foot petal to the actuating arm -- even with a good pin.  There is no way to fix this broken gate.  Upon contacting the manufacturer's customer service, they confirmed that there is on way to fix the foot petal and there is nothing they are willing to do to address the broken gate.In the end, we regret having bought these gates, and I am rather disappointed that the manufacturer doesn't seem to acknowledge these design flaws in their gates.

Part of the problem is that the entryway is extra wide--over 50 inches--and we had trouble finding gates wide enough just to fit.  After several frustrating attempts at finding a decent gate (including resultant trips back to the baby store for refunds/exchanges), we finally bought this foot-pedal operated gate (with 2 extensions) and it works awesome.  It's absolutely the nicest gate we have ever bought.  Although our son (18 months, ~28 pounds) has an idea of -how- it works, the foot pedal requires far too much pressure for him to get it to open.  This gate should be usable until he's at least 35, if not 40 pounds.  In addition, since it's made of metal bars and not some sort of crisscross pattern, my child cannot stick his toes in it and try to climb over--all he can do is step up on the bottom metal bar, which is only about 3 inches off the ground.As an added bonus, the gate is tall enough to keep kids out but not so tall that my cat can't jump over it easily.Only caveats I can think of:+ You have to tighten the tension screws periodically.+ The gate opening is a few inches narrower than would be ideal, so if you're \"wide\" like me you have to get used to kind of side-stepping through it.+ By default, the gate makes an audible \"click\" when it closes, which can wake a light-sleeping child; but with a little practice, you can get it to close soundlessly.+ The wrench provided for tightening is plastic, and once the tension screws get tight the wrench tends to slip off them a little too easily.All in all I would definitely recommend this gate to anyone.

Jordan", "helpful": [336, 338], "reviewText": "After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my favorite.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates.I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for.  The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and  2) the latch mechanismKidco Center Gateway:---------------------cost $85 & extensions $24  / gate is 29.5\" Tall  / fits 29.25\" to 37.5\" doorway width  / 1\" bar to step over / gate opening 22\"-  Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22\".  (This certainly won points from my 6'2\" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others).  I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature.-  This one also had the most secure latch feature.  You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru.  I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out.- This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75\" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75\" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become \"weaker\" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37\" and your door opening is 36.5\", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34\").-  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white.-  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1\" high (seems less of a tripping risk).-  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 08/04)-  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need.-  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up.-  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller.-  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it!Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate---------------------------------------------cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36\" Tall / fits 28\"-48\" doorway width / 2\" bar to step over / gate opening 19\"-  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal.-  The gate opening is about 19\" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider.-  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it.-  It does come with its own extensions in 5\" and 10\" so it more easily fits the wider doorways.-  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33\" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5\" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75\" as needed).-  It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far.  I also just like the way the taller gate looks.-  It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2\".-  If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money.First Years - Hands-Free Gate-----------------------------cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32\" Tall  / fits 29\"-34\" doorway width / 1.5\" bar to step over / gate opening 17\"- My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17\" wide! I'm 5'8\" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However...- The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width.- Good height to the gate.- It was very sturdy in my doorway.- This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor.- Fits only up to 34\" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension.-  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one.All three gates seemed to:- Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly.- Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall.- Were pretty easy to set up.- All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look \"cheaper\" to me than the others.Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.  Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value.

Ease of installation (seriously, this was a very easy install requiring no additional tools)Things I would improve:1.  The height of the gate.  My 3 year old is an escape artist, and he has already figured out that he can push several toys over to the gate and climb over it.  Not too big of a deal since he can safely climb up and down the stairs, but it doesn't keep him contained at all.2.  The instruction booklet that comes with the gate.  the booklet has instructions in several different languages in the front, and then referneces pictures that are in the back of the book.  This means that you must constantly flip pages when reading the instructions.

Let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and I have every confidence in the security of the gates I have installed. BUT, the first gate I purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install.  You can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall (even when there is a stud).  So, instead of including another set of screws that would've cost them about $0.90, Kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves.Well, this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day.  Kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market.  The thing they don't tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall.  Each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another (which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces).  However, because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place, this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate, make sure each of the 4 separate extension brackets and two separate support bars, and the 4 metal extension bars which the brackets slide over (none of which lockinto place in anyway) don't fall off, all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time...  I cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process.Throw me a bone Kidco!  How about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don't slide off while I'm trying to mount the gate?

Luckily, my mother-in-law was feeling generous with the baby gifts, and she bought us one.At first, my son hated it.  When he was little, I would put him in it, expecting him to sleep peacefully like so many other babies I had seen.  More often than not, though, he would thrash his head around and mash his face into my chest.  Boy was I glad we hadn't paid for this!But we kept trying...Once he was big enough to flip around...  he loved it!  I use this mostly when I am out and shopping, rather than putting him in his baby bucket in the cart.  He loves to be up high and look around.  Everyone remarks on what a quiet, happy baby he is.  (If they only lived with us...)No matter how much of a fusspot he is being, putting him in the Bjorn almost always makes him happy.  I keep it in the basket of my stroller when we go for walks, so if he starts wailing (as he usually does after about 2 miles) I can switch him to the Bjorn and he will be happy until we are home.He started teething early and one great thing about the Bjorn is it puts something soft and squishy right at mouth level for him to chew on.  Dealing with a baby who is teething but lacks the developmental skills to hold and use a teething toy is maddening - so this is a great little side benefit to the carrier.The first few times I wore the Bjorn, it did feel a little hard on my back.  Now I have no problems with that at all, and my baby is about 16 1/2 pounds.  (He's a big 4 1/2 month old...)I have no fears of him falling out of this thing, it holds him quite securely.  It's a little akward getting him into it when I am by myself and want him to be forward facing - but he doesn't seem to mind being flipped about and arched back over my shoulder for the little bit of time it takes.  It would be nice if there were some way transfer the baby from person to person without removing him from the Bjorn, but doing so would probably make the carrier a lot less secure.The longest I have ever walked using this carrier is about 1 1/2 miles.  Before he was born, I really thought this would be great for nice, long, arm swinging walks, but it hasn't really worked out that way.  At about that point, we both start to get a little fussy.  Also, his hands get really cold, I think because the top edge of the carrier cuts into his armpits and cuts off circulation.  I have tried adjusting the seat height, but I can't seem to find a way around this.  It doesn't happen if the top flap is fasted over his shoulders, but he likes to have his arms free and doing that restricts his arms.I haven't tried any other soft carriers to compare this to, but I did get a Maya Wrap sling.  My husband liked the sling when the baby was little, but I was never comfortable using it.  It made the baby so folded up, I was constantly checking his breathing, as well as constantly supporting his weight with my arm, which rather defeated the purpose of using the sling in the first place.  I really like how the carrier allows me to have my baby close, be arms free, yet still feel my baby is safe and supported.It would be nice if they made the regular carrier with just slightly longer straps.  This size works just fine for both my husband and I, but I really find it annoying how you have to pay so much extra for just two more inches of material if you and your spouse are very different in size.One more sort of so-so point about this is, they say you can use it for nursing, but I can't understand why you would want to.  I understand how to do it in theory, but I have never tried it and doubt I ever will.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Keeps my high-maintanance baby happy", "unixReviewTime": 1080777600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2004"}

Yes, it's most commonly used in the bathrooms for the toilet and sink but the kids also use this in our kitchen and bedrooms. In fact, we know we need more when we see them carry these around from room to room!Why do we keep buying these?-HEIGHT-Seems to be the perfect height to ensure a balance of safety and function. My 36\" 4 yo can reach sink hardware easily. My 28\" 2 yo can use it to reach the water in the sink.-STURDINESS-These are incredibly sturdy. After years of regular use, they still look brand new and have not deteriorated in any way. Unlike another review I read, I find it hard to tip these over. You have to try to tip them over or be very careless (if the kids don't place their entire feet on the step). These are meant for kids but can easily support me (170 lb).-SAFETY-With rubber grips on the feet, they don't move around at all on tile, hardwood, or carpet. Not only do they have rubber on the feet but the step is also rubberized. My kids have never slipped on these and they use them daily. Additionally, all corners are rounded.-DESIGN-They do not look as nice as wooden steps in my opinion but since they are plastic, they are easy to clean. All of ours are white and none of them have discolored. They look at home as part of a toddler's bathroom but look a little out of place in other rooms of the house.-RECOMMENDATION-All my kids love these, including our 18-month old climber.

He does not use this for climbing onto a toilet, so I cannot tell whether this will work for him.  My son is very tall 2-year old (38.5 inch tall), and this gives just enough boost for allowing him to wash his hands on his own.  If you baby is short, reaching to a faucet may be challenging.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "True that it does not slip!", "unixReviewTime": 1383004800, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2013"}

This is important, because toddlers move around, and rarely have a visual memory of where they have placed their feet:  the depth of this allows for some foot movement without danger of falling off (much less precision required).  The other added benefit of this is that an adult bum can sit on this very comfortably(!), as I do every time I'm in the bathroom assisting my daughter, who no longer needs the stool to get up on the potty.  MUCH better than squatting or standing.  I weigh 186 lbs, and can stand or sit on this without any creaking, buckling, or unstable movement.Finally, as an aesthetic concern:  I love that it comes in black and white, which looks very neutral in our B & W bath.

Here are the pros and cons of the bugs:Pros1) They can be hung from multiple places, including the car seat, bouncy seat, and swing.2) Can be used as wrist rattles3) Brightly colored, keeps my babies attention4) They don't hang down too far, so they don't hit my baby in the face while they are hooked to her car seat.Cons1) The dragonfly is supposed to have beads in its tail that rattle.  Unfortunately, the beads are so tightly packed into the tail that they don't rattle at all; also, there is a yellow mesh fabric that covers the tail so you can barely even see the beads.  I had researched this product online first before buying and was under the impression that the beads were easy to see in the tail.  I was very disappointed when I took this bug out of the package and it wasn't anything like how it was represented online.  The beads may as well not even be in the tail, since they are pretty much non-functioning.2) The dragonfly is also supposed to buzz and vibrate when you pull it down.  It does, but it only buzzes/vibrates for a split second, not nearly long enough for my baby to even realize what's going on!3)  The grasshopper is supposed to rattle, but when I shake it, I can barely hear the rattle sound coming from inside its body.  The ladybug is the only bug out of the three that has a nice chime sound that entertains my baby.I'm glad I bought these, because my baby does like them.

The wool pads contain lanolin, so they soothe the nipple, and because they're not holding the moisture in with plastic (and because wool wicks away moisture so well) it's incredibly healing for the nipples.Using both wool pads AND these breast shells have almost completely cleared up my nipple soreness issue.

Well, that wasn't the case - at least not in the beginning.  My newborn hated it.  He was uncomfortable with the forward facing position and didn't like that he couldn't see out the sides.  I felt I was smothering him in there.  When he was 3 months I tried it again with the front facing position and his arms through the holes.  He liked it better, but could only stand about 10 minutes.  When I took it off I had such extreme back pain I immediately took 2 Alleves - something I never do.  Well, he's a high maintainence guy, so I figured I would give it one more try.  I readjusted everything, and when he was four months I put him in it again.  This time no arm holes.  This was much better for both of us.  I was able to get him in and out much quicker without all the extra arm and leg buttons to do.  He liked having his arms free and looking out.  It was still hard on the back, but I concentrated on keeping my knees bent and a bit of a \"pelvic tilt.\"  We did 20 minutes a day for 3 days in a row.  It sounds kind of like more work than it's worth, but it really isn't that bad.  After that we were pros.  I now take him everywhere in it.  I have worn it for 2 hours at a time and walked a 5 mile hike in it.  He often just falls asleep in it (and he's a tough sleeper).  He's a big baby - 19 lbs. - I know I can use it until 25 lbs, but honestly I'm not sure if I'll want to at that size! He seems to be busting out of it already.

Those bottles leaked, the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips, he needed extensive burping, I didn't find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles. Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues. I am extremely happy with them.You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it's well worth the effort. It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles (I prefer not to use the dishwasher). The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi-pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6-8 weeks of regular use. I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9-pack which is available at other websites. When warming these bottles, if you find the fluid going up into the vent, just loosen the collar, the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again. If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge, the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent. You will receive Level-1 nipples with the starter kit/multi-packs, however you may want to graduate to Level-2 at 3-months of age, Level-2 at 6-months of age and the Y-cut nipples for any thick liquids (e.g milk with cereal).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only 'con' I can think of. Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk.My friend's babies with refulx did well on these bottles.

We ended up throwing all other bottles away. I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that. We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything. Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves. I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap). As to some reviewers complaints about leakage, it's true that if the inner tube gets full sometimes the milk can leak out the top - but this has only happened rarely and I've found that if I unscrew the cap and pull out the inner tube then put the tube back in (basically reassembling the bottle), the problem is resolved. The adjustment takes less than a minute and like I said, I've only had it happen once or twice. Otherwise the bottles, nipples and all the parts are really durable - especially the nipples. When we first bought the bottles, we bought all these replacement nipples in level 1 and ended up returning them because we never needed them. So, my only suggestions are1. hold off on buying extra nipples to see if you really need them (or at least don't open the package until you need to) and2. to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles. We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding.

I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield (20mm), the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield. Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand:Medela Contact Nipple Shield (20mm)This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant. It's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and \"sticks\" the best. The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning. I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes: 20mm and 24mm. It comes with just one shield, which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures, hoping that it would not be as high. Unfortunately, it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield, but also wider and thicker, making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch. Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands. In theory, the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact, but as another reviewer stated, all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes.

We've tried various brands that use all 3 methods. These bottles are an example of one-way vents - the base is designed to let air flow in but prevent fluid from flowing out in the opposite direction. They do an OK job preventing bubbles in the formula, but they have two main problems: 1) they tend to leak if you don't assemble correctly, and also if shaken or if the membrane becomes a bit worn. 2) The design of the vent requires some negative pressure to allow the air to flow into the bottle. This means a slight resistance to your baby's suckling effort. The last thing you want when addressing any feeding problem is resistance to your baby's suckling.We found the most effective feeding design is the open airway used by Dr Browns bottles. So if you're looking for something to address a colic/feeding problem, that's the way to go.

It did work if I loosened the bottom to let the air out while she was drinking, but after drenching her with milk a few times I gave that up.

However, we bought Playtex bottles for the first 2 kids. My wife is a Family Nurse Practitioner and she considers this type of bottles the best for our kids. The main reason? When the baby drinks her milk out of the bottle, pressure builds up inside. With regular bottles, it is very easy for the silicone/plastic nipple to contract so it makes up for the milk that was taken out. That in turn makes it hard for the baby to continue drinking. One solution would be to constantly turn the regular bottle or just take it out and pull the nipple out once in a while. With this Playtex set, you do not have to worry about it. It is very convenient and the nipple does not get stuck to the bottle. The only potential downside is having more pieces to clean - as each bottle has 2 extra pieces to help with the pressure flow on the bottom. This is definitely recommended. We prefer this set for kids 1 year and older, versus the bulky infant ones, as the kids can actually hold the bottle themselves.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for 12 months and up", "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012"}

Most times he doesn't have to burp afterwards.  There is no spillage from the side of his mouth and he will drink his milk straight and not have to be burped half way so that he can finish eating.  I have never had the bottles leak because I washed them all and assembled them and left them like that. I do clean them after every usage with soap and water.  Then once a week I take them apart, sterilize the bottles in the sterilizer and boil the nipples and disc. I immediately reassemble them and then test them with water to see if they are leaking.

The VentAire system is interesting, and I am surprised at how well it works - when it works.This bottle is very picky, when it works it works great, but there are a couple of situations where this bottle has issues. The bottom of the screw cap and the latex vent disk must be 100% dry for the bottle to work. If the vent disk or screw cap are the slightest bit wet, it will create a suction and the air will not vent properly. This will cause air to come in from the nipple, defeating the purpose of this bottle. Also, if you are using a bottle warmer these bottles won't work. I haveThe First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, which uses steam to warm the bottle, and it does not work with this type of bottle. The steam gets the vent disk wet, which renders the system useless.While these bottles work great under ideal circumstances, I can't recommend them.

While those WERE once a massive improvement, VentAire is the newest texhnology for allowing better pressure equalization, and a more cormftable feeding experience for both mother an baby that more closely mimics the natural position of Breastfeeding.  This is done by using specially angled bottles and the exlcusive VentAire disk system.  I started out with the Newborn set so I'm now a little more adept at inserting the disks into place and using the bottle itself.  I'm pleased that they are making it clear that their bottles are BPA-free since that's an issue that now concerns most new parents or experienced parents with a new baby after a long time off Bottle Duty.I have read the complaints about the slow flow nipple and I have found that I did not encounter anywhere near the frustration others have reported.  However, that was for a Newborn sized bottle.  It did take a little getting used to but before swithing to the Fast Flow and perhaps creating waterfalls of milk or formula all over your infants face and your chest, check out the Medium Flow Nipples available here on Amazon:Playtex BPA Free VentAire Advanced Silicone Nipples, 2 Pack, Medium FlowThe set  pictured here is a 9 ounce set of 3 bottles all with the FAST FLOW nipples.  If you are already needing a 9 Ounce Bottle, you probably will not need the Slow flow Nipple anyway but if you do, you should know that you can by the Slow Flow, Medium Flow and Fast Flow Nipples separately in 2-packs here at Amazon.  I picked up some Medium Flow Nipples locally and had some better success with them earlier on.  I had a difficult time finding them but I'm pleased to see that AMAZON carries all three Nipple stages.  It's best to stock up on those since you'll go through the Nipples faster than the bottles themselves, which are petty sturdy and easy to clean.I don't use a bottle warmer since I pump.  I warm the milk up from the refrigorator in the Pumps packaging.  I cannot see how a traditional Bottle-Warmer would accomodate this new system.  Personally, I've never had the need myself but I Imagine this may be a deal breaker for some Moms.

There are also many different parts that need to be disassembled for cleaning.I have both the \"wide\" and \"standard\" versions and there isn't any difference when it comes to feeding. The nipples are basically the same and my baby has no preference. I prefer the wide version because it is shorter (&lt;7\") which makes it easier to fit into wall cabinets.As far as reducing gas, I haven't noticed any difference between these bottles andThe First Years Breastflow Bottlewhich I also use. I typically prefer The First Years bottle because of the slower flow. However, this may not be a problem once my baby gets bigger.UPDATE: After using this for a couple months, I find it is too much of a pain to deal with the multiple different seals and rings.

What grabbed me on these was the claim that baby can comfortably control the milk flow due to the special venting system, as well as less gas for baby.  Baby definitely seems to do better with these bottles, less dribbling of milk out of her mouth around the nipple, very little choking episodes (again, this is related to her prematurity), and seems much more content after her feeds so clearly less gas.The bottles are easy to hold, lightweight, and easy to clean.  I mostly handwash, and others have pointed out it's a pain given all the parts to the bottle, but I don't find it troublesome at all.  Actually, since both the top and bottle come off, the bottle part itself is just basically a tube that is very easy to clean (no special bottle brush needed).  Assembly is simple, but in order for the vent to work 100%, the parts must be bone dry, the silicone vent must sit on the bottom perfectly and screwed on tight, and the nipple part pulled tightly against the ring to ensure no leaks.  I have also encountered a problem on occasion where there seems to be a vacuum created and milk would no flow throw the nipple.  Imagine my surprise at noticing that baby was sucking away for at least 5 minutes before I realized what was going on there- but just a quick readjustment of the parts and suddenly the flow of the milk was working again.I'd recommend these, especially if you are looking for a bottle that helps baby control the milk flow.EDIT 12/16/11: Now that my daughter is 6 months, and I have a few months more experience with these bottles, I have to increase from 4 star review to a 5 star review.  Cleaning is a breeze (I mostly handwash, but on occasion I throw them in the dishwasher, either way gets them very clean).  Also, we have gone up to the moderate flow nipple and we have not encountered the vacuum problem where she was unable to get any milk through.  In hindsight, this may not have been the bottle but rather my daughter given she was a preemie and at the time of the original review still had some feeding difficulties.  She also has reflux, and these bottles have really helped with decreasing the amount of air she swallows.I am very happy with these bottles and highly recommend them to the pricier brands out there that make the same claims.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Baby Does Well With These", "unixReviewTime": 1312156800, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2011"}

These are the narrow nipple unlike the drop-ins, so the nipples are not interchangeable.  I do like these because the top will screw directly onto a ready-to-feed bottle (I use Similac) and I don't have to use one-time use nipples.I was really hoping the bottle would be easier for my son to hold on to since it is angled, but I think he just likes me holding it, so he has yet to hold the bottle himself.

The bottom has a seal in it that pops out easily and is simple to clean.  They wash up quickly.  The bottles do not fit into my Avent microwave sterilizer.

He moved up to the medium at 2.5 months, but I don't see him moving up any time soon. I would prefer they come with medium since that would be used more frequently to begin with when moving up to the larger bottles.Overall, a great bottle.  I suggest picking up some medium-flow nipples if your little one has been using slow-flow since fast-flow can be a big jump.

They have worked nicely for the following reasons:1. The bottles did not cause the dreaded \"nipple confusion\" when transitioning between the bottle at daycare and breastfeeding when baby is with mom.2. Although it does have a lot of pieces, the fact that the bottle disassembles completely makes it easy to thoroughly clean and disinfect its various parts.The bottles have presented one challenge:1. Replacement parts - like extra slow flow nipples - can be hard to find.  Nipples wear out, and wanting extras to have on hand, I ended up buying extra bottles instead because it was nearly impossible to find the slow flow variety (and it was cheaper to buy extra bottles from Amazon than to pay the exorbitant shipping from the two sources who sold the nipples separately).UPDATE (3/2012): As my daughter has reached her first birthday, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. We have also used Playtex Drop-Ins. This is how the two compare:1. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).2. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). (In both cases, this refers to the slow flow nipple variety for each bottle.)2. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air.

I feel a lot better about them getting really clean and they are easy to throw in the dishwasher.  The only downside with them is that they take a little longer to heat in the bottle warmer and sometimes the hot water from the warmer gets stuck in the bottom and can drink down the sides and get on your baby if you don't wipe it down before you give it to them.  They don't fit with Medela pumping stuff and all of my nipples are the same flow, which is fine for my baby from 6 months up.  I'm bit sure if they make slow flow.  Overall, my favorite out of the ones listed below.Dr. Brown's: Also pretty good but they have overall too many parts (bottle, nipple, screw on lid, straw thing and other little venting part.)  I have somehow managed to lose a bunch of the random parts so now I only have 3 complete sets.  They are also kind of a pain to clean, the long straw thing is hard to get clean.

They work well with my Medela pumping stuff but that's about it.  They also only have 3 parts, which is nice, but they don't have anyway to release the air so I have to stop my baby from drinking every once in a while to release the backed up air.Lansinoh Momma: These bottles are a little gimmicky.

The flow is way too fast for a baby under 6 months and for some reason my little girl decided at some point she just didn't like them at all.

We ended up using all of them so we didn't have to wash them as often, but I have to say the Playtex bottles were the best as they help prevent gas and colic.  We plan on using these more than any of the other types with the next baby as they make things a lot easier.  Although the shape of the bottle has that slight tilt to it, I don't think it really makes it any more difficult to dry on one of those special racks.  The only down side is there was occasionally a couple drips of milk coming out of the bottom of the bottle (not sure if I did something wrong to allow or if something can be done to prevent that).Comparing Playtex bottles to the others we tried, I have to say the Playtex bottles are one of the few bottles out there that are trying to prevent colic and gas.  The only other brand I can think of that does this is Dr. Brown.  Slight dripping isn't entirely unusual with other bottles, as the glass bottles we got would actually drip where the nipple would screw on.

Or at least the hassle of cleaning the bottles didn't seem to be worth whatever minor improvements we were seeing in gas reduction.  They worked as advertised when we were using the slow flow nipples.  The vacuum created by our daughter sucking milk out of the nipple was regulated through the gasket in the bottom of the bottle in lieu of drawing air through the nipple when she took a breather and creating air bubbles in the milk.  Super!  She seemed to spit up less and burp more easily.But when we switched to the Medium flow nipples, the gasket didn't seem to be able to keep up and air was being pulled in through the nipple, creating air bubbles in the milk and we believe it contributed to the return of her spitting up more.  Of course it could also be that it was her growing and changing how she sucked/drank that made the differences, and not the bottles, so it's hard to know for sure.One intermittent problem is leaking.  Sometimes even though the cap is screwed on tight, once our daughter starts to drink, milk will flow out from under the ring, down our hands an onto her chest.  It always seems to happen when she's ravenous and she gets really irritated when we have to pull the bottle from her, wipe it off and readjust the ring.  Also, milk can leak from the bottom, so don't place it on any surface that needs a coaster, unless it's on, well, a coaster.  That's why I am only giving them three stars.  Our daughter is now seven and a half months and is using the Fast flow without excessive gas issues or other air related problems.What I do know is that these bottles were infinitely easier to clean since I just put all the parts in the dishwasher without worrying about using a special brush to clean them.  The wide mouth bottles fit perfectly across two tines of the middle level rack in our Miele dishwasher and the nipples, gaskets and bottom fit in the top utensil tray.  One tip:  Buy enough bottles so that you don't have to wash any of them by hand.  Just run the dishwasher each night and save yourself precious time.  Given how expensive the Dr. Brown bottles were, that wasn't something I could do when using them.  Also the wide mouth is *much* easier to fill with powder to make formula than the narrow bottles and I have space to swirl the formula to mix it (limiting the introduction of bubbles) without needing a spoon when I'm out or in a hurry.  I recommend them for their price and ease of use, but warn that they can leak.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great with Slow Flow but doesn't compensate fast enough for Medium or Fast", "unixReviewTime": 1308009600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2011"}

My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside.So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !).

I bought these guys & the handles.  Our son loves the handles, but has really struggled with the spout.  I would go so far as to say he cannot drink from it.  I eventually caved & bought 2 Nuby 2 Handle Cups with Soft Spouts.  He can drink out of the super soft spout much easier.  I do wish this product would have worked for him because when I screw on the Nuby lid, the spout does not align with the handles.  The Avents *always* align.  To sum it up, I am giving it 4 stars even though it didn't work for our family, because (1) I love that Avent offers a modification for consumers, (2) the handles rock & the spout & handles align super easily, & (3) my baby is exclusively breastfed & has very little experience with bottles (1 bottle, 1 time) - I believe a baby who knows how to drink from a bottle would have a much easier time with this product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Didn't Work for my Breastfed Baby", "unixReviewTime": 1302825600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2011"}

Key word, 'IDEA'.PROS:- It's a 4-in-1: elbow rest, knee rest, storage pocket for wash/shampoos, and then later can be used as a stepping stool.- Cute little ice animal theme, polar bears, penguins, whales, etc.- The elbow rest has suction cups that attach to the tubside.- The little storage pockets that hang on the side are helpful for all those crazy bath toys and products babies come with.CONS:- What I did not consider before purchasing this item was the placement of my bathtub's faucet and the toilet. We have two bathrooms, and both bathtubs, on the side where the faucet is the toilet is directly next to it. Generally, if one were to be giving their child a bath, they would be right by the faucet so that they could control the water flow/temperature.... With toilets directly next to my bathtubs, I can't exactly kneel with 3 inches between the two porcelain objects. Hah. I sit uncomfortably on the closed toilet instead and lean over the whole time, which SUCKS.- The stool does not raise up to be any higher than what the picture shows. It is a very VERY short stepping stool, and will be useless for quite a while.- The suction cups for the elbow rest POP OFF almost every time you lean on it, which defeats the purpose. They were very hard to get to stay put in the first place before anyone ever leaned on it.- Also, the top of the elbow rest CRACKED after maybe the 2nd time we used it.Conclusion:I LOOOVED the idea of this product.

It's nice that you can reverse it to have the soft fuzzy side out when it's cold and the smooth cotton side out when it's warm.I have to reemphasize what some of the reviews say - be careful when using anything extra in a car seat.  The reason is that, heaven forbid you were in a car crash, any extra padding could compress too much creating too much gap in the straps holding your little one in the seat.  I know that this says you can use in in a car seat, just make sure that any padding in a car seat is installed properly.

The first and most obvious use is the fact that you can have a bottle warming while you're changing your baby's diaper, getting them dressed etc...While some will complain that it takes 5 minutes, I find that to be a gross over estimate.  It takes not quite 2 minutes from refridgerator to warm.

It's extremely easy to use so it can even be easily used in the middle of the night.The one weakness that I found has to do with warming up breast milk that's been frozen.  It seems to have some sort of timer that times how long the water in the resevoir has boiled to not let the milk get too hot.  If breast milk has not had an opportunity to thaw out in the fridge yet it will obviously take more than just 1 press of the button for the milk to thaw and be warmed up.  The problem is that even though there's still ice in the bottle the water will be warm and so the heating element that heats the water will shut off after 10 seconds.  What I had to do was shake the bottle to more evenly distribute the temperature through out the bottle and add more cool water to the resevoir 3-4 times.  This situation is easily fixed however by remembering (easier said than done when you aren't sleeping much!!) to take out a bottle 12-18 hours in advance.Overall, great product, great value and a must have.

Our babysitter got over it fast so she went to walmart and bought some slower-flowing nipples (same brand, same fit) and is swearing by them. I BF my baby, but when we wean him we'll be sure to get a slower-flow nipple top and just use the fast-flow for his rice cereal/BM concoctions. Definitely would buy again if I hadn't already stocked up, haha!One thing to note:: These bottles DO NOT work if you're trying to switch parts with any other brand.(which is why the docking of 1*) It's not as wide a neck as Breastflow and Gumdrop, and not small enough to fit standard hospital bottles and Medela brand. If you get this brand of bottle, you'll only be able to use the corresponding parts.For us it's no biggie, it works the best and has so far proven to be a pretty decent investment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The bent neck REALLY helps with gas.", "unixReviewTime": 1386892800, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2013"}

These seemed to be along the same lines and cheaper, so we gave them a try.Overall, I would say that these are a great product for their price.  High quality, durable, and has a wide nipple so our daughter can go back and forth from bottle to breast.  Like the Avent bottles, they are easy to clean and there are not any thin tube/weird parts that are hard to clean and need to be replaced periodically (which is what drove me away from the Dr. Browns and Tommee Tippie bottles.)  They do have one more piece than the Avent bottles, but that's not too much of a big deal.  In my mind, the simpler the design is, the better.The things that I do not like as much are relatively minor.  First, the nipple has a softer ring section that seems to allow it to collapse in (not flat) if there is too much pressure in the bottle.  The second is that although the bottle does vent just like it aims to do, it seems that it takes more pressure in the bottle to cause it to vent compared to the Avent bottles.  This is only really a problem when the little one is getting lazy at the end of her bottle, and will just start to let go of the nipple causing it to vent through the nipple.  Third, now that the little one is starting to want to hold her bottle herself, she has a harder time holding these.  Over all, these are minor issues.They are less expensive, so I could see these being a good alternative for some parents.I would grab these in a pinch if there were no Avent bottles, but I'm sticking to the Avent.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not Bad, still prefer other brand", "unixReviewTime": 1326844800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2012"}

It may be because he's getting older and eating more baby food and all, but I'll gladly give credit to the bottles!I'm going to point out a few things about these bottles that we've observed and you can decide whether that part is positive or negative.-After using \"straight\" bottles, these do take a bit of getting used to. Since the top is curved, it's easier to spill the formula if you don't turn it with the lower side towards you when pouring it in.-The small bottle is 6 ounces as opposed to 5 ounces on all the other bottles we've used. At first, I was really excited about this, but you still can't make a 6 ounce bottle using powdered formula. There's not enuogh room to mix it up. So, you can still only use it as a 4 ounce bottle IF using powdered formula. There's plenty of room if you're using liquid or breast milk for 6 ounces. (This set only has the 9 ounce bottles, though).-There's 6 pieces to put together for each bottle. Two pieces go together at the bottom, and 3 at the top. I'll admit sometimes it gets to be a pain with so many peices, but most bottles these days have a lot of pieces.-There's different colors, so there's a variety. I like that the colors are gender neutral. When you're putting the bottles together it does take a little more time trying to match up the tops and bottoms according to color, but that part isn't absolutely necessary. I like them to match, though.-The \"slow\" nipple is VERY slow! The \"fast\" nipple is VERY fast. I would prefer and in between. If you're using breast milk, the \"slow\" nipple is perfect. If you put cereal in the bottle, the fast nipple is perfect for that. It's fast enough that you don't have to widen the hole or anything.

I started out using the Playtex disposables with the natural shape nipple while breastfeeding - and they were great - but when I started the transition to formula gas became more of an issue for my baby.  My best friend and my sister swore by these.  (They both hated the Avent ones.)  I bought these and I haven't looked back.When I bought the first set my baby was still using the slow flow nipples, so I got the 9 oz size, bought slower nipples and just switched them out.  Around 6 or 7 months I noticed that my baby seemed to be working too hard when taking her bottle.  I switched back to the stage 2 nipples.  My best friend had warned me that they took a little while for the baby to get used to, and she was right.  She was used to sucking really hard, and so the faster flow gagged her a little.  She dribbled a lot more out of her mouth, too.  After a week or so she learned to slow down.  She still dribbles a little at almost a year, but she's a baby.  She doesn't seem to mind, so why should I?  I have plenty of burp cloths to clean her up with!I have had a few leaks, BUT each time it was my fault.  Either I didn't take the time to make sure the disk was fully inserted into the rim, I didn't pull the nipple all the way through the nipple ring securely, or I didn't line up the threads of the nipple ring when I screwed it on so it wasn't on completely.  Sometimes you're just in a rush.  But, I have used these bottles all day, every day for at least 6 months now, and they are holding up beautifully.

One of the best pieces of advice I got came from a salesperson at Babies 'R Us.  She said instead of buying a lot of bottles up front or a big starter pack, buy one or two of the individual ones in the brand(s) you want to try.  Then get one or two of the alternate nipples (if the bottle comes with silicone, buy one or two latex).  By doing this you have them on hand, so there is no middle of the night baby-won't-take-the-bottle trauma.  When the baby comes you can try out just one or two.  She said to still register for the big box, but just don't open it.  If they aren't what you or the baby likes you can return the starter pack and get the ones that work for you.  Smart cookie.

HUGE MISTAKE!First let me tell you, NEVER buy a lot of one type of bottle before having your baby test them out! I sterlized all the avent bottles, wanting to be prepared when I needed them, and now I have a million of them around the house collecting dust because I cannot return them! For a few reasons the Avents did not work for us ((not just based on my boys preferances either, I all in all do NOT reccomend those bottles if you or your baby do not like the VentAires!)). I purchased these bottles and I LOVE them! My boys only take the natural nipple, and I have yet to see another bottle with a similar nipple shape. They do NOT leak if you put them together properly. First of all, you must make sure that the bottom of the bottle is secured TIGHTLY, and that the disk is put in correctly for you to get the advantages of the vent system. There is no \"special trick\" to getting the bottles to seal correctly so there aren't any leaks, which is how a bottle should be... you shouldn't have to line up arrows or wet the rim first, thats none-sense. The curve allows me to easily feed a baby ((or two!)) and the shape is great for the release of air to reduce gas problems ((which my boys have never had a huge problem with, and I thank the ventaire bottles!)) It is VERY easy to clean, I just rinse out the bottles in the sink ((just some warm water and soap)), and then I put the long bottle part on the highest rack of my dishwasher, and the rings, bases, nipples and disks go into the smaller baskets that I purchased for the dishwasher. I have NEVER had a problem with the dishwasher ruining nipples or disks, and so far no leaks ((although I do recommend changing nipples and disks every few months, they DO start to wear!)).There IS one thing I would like to add. One of my friends who has a daughter a bit older than my boys was at first dissapointed in the ventaires because they leaked in her diaper bag while traveling with them... We realized that this is because the bottle caps are NOT meant for preventing leaks while thrown into a diaper bag! They are for keeping the nipple sanitary on-the-go. Therefore when I need to bring bottles on a day trip, I put the right about of powdered formula into the bottles required, and carry around a large water bottle separately. When its feeding time I add water, shake, and have a ready-made bottle! If there is still liquid in the bottle, I cary it straight up in the stroller, or cap it with the solid caps ((sold separately... I found them at BRU)).All in all GREAT bottles, highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "love em!", "unixReviewTime": 1145145600, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2006"}

I like that this bottle can use the same nipple as the Dropins. Our daughter has never had any issues transitioning between breast and bottle. Playtex offers a variety of nipple (slow,medium,fast,variable,&cereal;) flows so it is easy to find a nipple flow that matches your flow :), also a very important factor when switching. My daughter has never had any problems with spit up or cholic so I all I can say is that these bottles didn't create any problems.Pros to using the VENATIRE WIDE/NATURAL SHAPE is that they're reusuable so no additional cost like the dropins. They're really easy to clean since they come apart, and the parts are easy to clean. You don't have to use the bottle rings that come with the kit, as they fit right on the adapter. Just remove the bottle from the adapter ring after pumping, put the sealing disc on, and store until feeding. I've found that the storage kits (deluxe kit and the ones in the permium nurser gift set) including sealing discs that are the flimsy silicone pieces that fit into the nipple ring work better with the Ventaires than the sealing discs in this kit. We've had a few leak from the top when mixing (we have to add some prune juice for our daughter) a bottle with the hard top sealing disc. We store these bottles on their bottom in the fridge, and have never had a problem with leaks. So really, I would recommend looking for the deluxe/premium storage kit.When you're ready for the bottle just warm up some water in the microwave, and then plop the bottle into the water. It only takes a few minutes since, and whalaa (NO NEED FOR A BOTTLE WARMER! We warm Dropins this way too, it's a little faster since the liners are thinner).When the bottle is warm remove the sealing disc, & the insert the nipple.I have never tried freezing milk in the bottles although I know that the storage kit is advertized to be able too. If I have extra milk I just freeze it in an ice cube tray, and store in Ziploc freezer bags. This system has turned out great for if lil' one finishes her bottle and is still hungry but doesn't need another entire feeding, just put a cube or two in...no wasted milk!OVERALL, THIS BOTTLE IS A GREAT CHOICE FOR THE BREASTFEEDING MOM WHO CAN'T BE READILY AVAILABLE 24/7 :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great with the Playtex Breast Milk Storage System for Pumping!", "unixReviewTime": 1269129600, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2010"}

I have used bottles in the past that are not comfortable to hold, so I think it's worth mentioning that it fits nicely in your hand.When it comes to cleaning these bottles you can be sure you have every nook and cranny clean since it fully disassembles, but that also means that you have lots of pieces to keep tabs on.

The nipples are interchangeable, so my son has no problem with the bottle change-up.I was really hoping the bottle would be easier for my son to hold on to since it is angled, but I think he just likes me holding it, so he has yet to hold the bottle himself.  I do find it much easier for me to hold when he is laying down because I can move around and it fits perfectly under my chin or it sits at he correct angle without me having to hold it at all unlike a straight bottle that falls over easily.The bottle unscrews at both the top and the bottom.  The bottom has a seal in it that pops out easily and is simple to clean.  They wash up quickly and I usually put them in my Avent microwave sterilizer.My one complaint is that the bottles come with fast-flow nipples.  My son is a medium-flow bottle eater.  Fast is just too fast for him.  He moved up to the medium at 2.5 months, but I don't see him moving up any time soon. I would prefer they come with medium since that would be used more frequently to begin with when moving up to the larger bottles.Overall, a great bottle.

The only time we had a consistent leak to troubleshoot, it was due to the bottom stopper having a tear in the inner ring.Replacement parts: I'm really confused as to why the bottom stoppers are not available in most stores.

Although she is older now (not a newborn) I have been quite tired and upset with Dr. Brown's bottles that we were using since her birth. They have discolored greatly, yucky stuff was caked on inside the inner tubing, very hard to clean out, but most of all they constantly leaked after a month or two of owning. I replaced them twice and each time they have leaked from the screw cap area. If you make them to tight they leak, to loose they leak, very fine line.... soo when I had the opportunity to try these out and had something to compare them to I was quite happy to do so.Right off the bat I liked the design of them, and the way the top was angled. The nipples are natural shaped and my daughter went from the old bottles to these without any hesitation or trouble to the nipple. In fact she likes them better and seeks them out when wanting her bottle. The state 2 nipples are fast flow and for her were perfect. I like how the bottle and the top come off so you can clean the entire bottle with easy, rather then a fight. Most importanly though they did not leak at all. The last thing you want is to travel and have your bottle leak, or spill coming out of the cap areas. Of course flip a bottle upside down most will leak from the nipple. But none should leak from the screw cap area, and I was happy these did not leak. We have used them well over a month now, going on two and love them!feeds your baby with virtually no bubbles and less gas and spit ups. It has a unique leak-proof bottom vent that controls bubbles and an angled 9-oz. bottle that promotes semi-upright feeding and deters ear infections.

The bottom of the conventional bottles would never get quite that clean, even when I use those bottle brushes. The brushes don't get into the crevices on the bottom so there's that thin layer of dried milk or something that's always there.3. Ergonomically correct in shape. Easy for me to hold, and for the baby to hold as well. Since the bottle curves upwards, the weight of the bottle is dispursed centrally so the baby has an easier time holding it.4.

These are a vast improvement over the previous design!  The disc in the bottom is bigger - it's not a small little flap that can get lost in the dishwasher or even the countertop.  It's a bigger silicone ring, much like the nipple, but the center isn't solid so that the bottom of the bottle can 'breathe' and let air in.  The other advantage is that the bottom silicone ring screws in and fits very well into the bottom ring so it's hard not to get a good seal and create a leak.  I tried these with our daughter who is honestly too old for a bottle just to see what she would say.  She CHUGS.  Not once did she have to stop out of frustration with the flow or to let air in.  I never saw bubbles in the water, either.  With the old design, sometimes you still had to take the bottle from the baby to let the air catch up.  The bent shape is perfect - not too much, not too little.  It's wide, so younger babies may have problems holding it on their own initially, but for me, that didn't detract from their overall use or awesomeness.From a breastfed-baby standpoint, these are probably not the best idea because, if you hold the bottle upside down, or tilted at an angle similar to what you would for a feeding, the fluid just drips out.  They require very little, if any, actual suction to remove the fluid from the bottle, so it's easy for baby to be lazy with the bottle, and consequently, to want to be a lazy nurser.  While the baby has to work a bit to have an active flow, if baby is sleepy, there will be breastmilk/formula dripping whether baby is sucking or not.I like these better than the Dr. Brown's version because there are fewer parts and the nipples seem to be more than moms' in design.  Babies will certainly voice their opinions, but if you're in need of something that helps eliminate air and potential gas, these may be a good choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Vast improvement over previous version!", "unixReviewTime": 1325808000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2012"}

I received the neutral kit that included green and yellow bottles that would be appropriate for either a boy or girl. You get three 9 ounce bottles with fast flow nipples.  I have the newborn Playtex kit and continue to use the slow flow nipples because my baby is a fast eater and this helps her slow down. The nipples are also supposed to be naturally shaped to aid in breastfeeding, but my baby is exclusively fed pumped milk, so I cannot attest to that ability.The bottles are different because of the Ventaire technology. The bottom of the bottle twists off and a rubber vent fits inside. Make sure you twist the bottom on correctly, or milk will leak. They are a little stiff, but after more use it is easier to twist them off and on. Tiny holes in the bottom of the bottle allow air to escape, so your baby is not taking in extra air while eating. I saw bubbles popping and could hear the air escaping while my baby ate. Very cool.The bottles are shaped with a angle which allows for mothers to hold the baby in a more upright position while eating. This helps reduce gas and supposedly colic. It comes into narrow sides that the baby can grip when it is able.All of the bottles come with caps that fit very tightly, making transporting milk easier. Cleaning is easy, just twist off the top and bottom and remove the nipples and vents.  All parts have held up well through multiple washings.I would highly recommend these bottles. I have also used Avent, and they are good, but I do believe the Ventaire technology has made my baby less gassy and less fussy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable bottles", "unixReviewTime": 1324512000, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2011"}

I discovered negative #1 in the store: it uses a giant safety pin (as well as a strap) to attach to the seatback. My car has a leather interior, and the last thing I wanted to do was poke holes in the leather! I tried just using the strap, but that is supposed to go around the headrest, and there is no headrest for the center of the backseat, just the right and left sides. Since the safest place for a baby is in the headrest-less center, the strap was out. There was also a velcro tape that we could use to stick the mirror onto the seatback. The negatives there were a) sticky glue residue on the leather and b) when we need to fold down the rear seat for transporting bikes or something equally large, the rear seat would fold precisely right down where the mirror would be, so we'd be constantly removing it and the velcro tape and then reattaching it. Highly impractical for any vehicle with a leather interior or with a rear seat that folds down in the middle.

The key is to aim the valve on the inside properly.  I use medela parts, so for my equipment I'm referring the little yellow valve piece with the white silicone flapper... I aim the white flapper so that it lines up and directly faces one of the four sets of threads.  If the flapper is aimed anywhere in between those threads, then it can get up inbetween and escape out.

The little 4-oz bottles that originally came with the pump worked great at first - but our twins are growing fast, and now regularly eat more than 4 ounces per feeding.That left us with two options: my wife could start taking a large cooler with her so that she could pump into more than one bottle per side each session (which would be a long, inconvenient, and somewhat messy process to change bottles mid-pumping) or to pump into larger bottles.  Using these adapters, she can pump right into the bottles that we use for feeding - saving transfer steps in many cases, and the size of the container can grow with our kids.

Jessica gets hungry, and starts to fuss a little. For you, normally you'd probably think &#34;No big deal, I'll just whip out my food bringers.&#34; Not so easy for dad though, is it? Nope.

Once I received it (I got 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs), I read the very short and easy directions, and voila!  Perfect warmth on first use.  Whoever who states its too hot or too cold and complains about it clearly has not read the directions and did not try again because it tells you what to do if its not the temp you want.  To use this simple tool, you need to know if you have an old school bottle or the newer wide mouth bottle and how many ounces your bottle can hold (not how many ounces you're using) and whether you're starting from refrigerated or room temp.  These factors will tell you how much water to pour in the heater using a measuring vial that it comes with.  Press the button down (not in, I thought my warmers were broken) and you'll hear a click or see the light go off when it's done (in about a minute or so...amount of time for a diaper change).  If you leave it in there after its done it will keep heating and get too hot, just like when you're cooking on the stove and turn off the burner and your food keeps cooking.  Keep a rag/towel handy to wipe off the moisture around the bottle when its done.The reason why I give it only 4 stars is because the measuring vial is a pain in the a$$ to fill each time and you have to be exact with the amount of filling water to make your bottle the right temp, but the filling lines are so close together.  I'm planning on using a syringe so that I can have a fail safe, thoughtless, easy way to get the right amount of water in the heater.

Secondly, the bottle warmer heats the milk too hot if the instructions are followed precisely.

Like others have mentioned, it takes an incredibly long time to warm a bottle in a pan of hot water when you have a crying baby who wants to eat immediately ~ so, this little product is great since it only takes a few minutes to warm up a bottle.There is definitely a bit of a learning curve to this product so that you get the temperature you want every time.  The warmer does come with a guide of how much water to use to create the steam heat and I've used this as a starting point.  My baby seems to like room temperature fluids so actually warming a bottle for her takes literally a minute or two at most since I am not heating to a higher temperature. Also, I learned the hard way that adding even just a few more drops of water (say filling to the 8 instead of the 7 on the little measuring dispenser) makes a huge temperature difference, so once you know exactly how much water you need, stick with it.  The other variable to this device is the little plastic ring that is placed over the top of the warmer (it states \"Not to be used with disposable bottles\" around the top of it) adds to keeping the steam within the warming chamber- so if you take it off it make take an extra bit of water to get the milk warmed to baby's preference.  I took this ring off because I just couldn't get it to sit flat over the removable basket.The product is fairly small and doesn't take up too much counter space, something that was also important to me since I hate clutter on kitchen counters.

It saves time and makes a perfect bottle every time!As some of the other reviewers note, you DO need to read the directions to find out how much water to use with the amount of liquid you are heating.  For example, use the marking of 7 ml of water on the included measuring tool for 3-4 oz of milk or formula.  The measuring tool attaches to the side of the warmer so that it is always handy.All you do is measure the water and pour it into the warmer, then add the bottle.  Do not have a lid or nipple already on the bottle.  As long as you use the right amount AND wait for the water to evaporate entirely and turn itself off, you get a perfect bottle!

First thing first, this bottle warmer is available at Walmart for $15. I saw the price on Amazon going from $15-$35. So just beware and don't get rips off.We have been using this warmer to warm up frozen breastmilk for 9 months and had no issue at all. Other than the deposits in the heat plate even though we been using distilled water the entire time.We know this warmer wasn't designed for frozen breastmilk but formila in room tempreture. However, other warmer works better for breastmilk are just too expensive. Also due to the bottle storage we use (no bags), we wanted to give this bottle a try. In order to get it to work, we have to experiment and find out the best amount of water measurement to pour into the steamer.The milk bottle we use are the medela plastic one (ok with high heat), we stay away from glass bottle because they get over heated easy and very hard to control the tempreture. Now every bottle of breastmilk we have has different volume of milk but in avg we have about 120ml to 150ml, I take out the bottle from the freezer, turn the cap half open (enough for it to breath but not losen). Then I fill up the measuring tube full (i don't even need those number line these days, they are useless for my purpose), I pour all water in there, set the bottle in the steamer, and I cover it with a coffee mug that fit perfectly (not tight), turn the switch and after 3-4 mins, it will auto turn off, usually there'll be a small cube of frozen milk floating in the bottle, that's why I leave it alone covered for another 2 mins before I take it out and feed the baby. If I'm heating up 150ml- 200ml, I just steam it again with 1/5 to 1/4 water filled in the tube. Everything comes out perfect.This thing is awesome and save us a lot of money.

So I hear warming the milk makes it easier on the tummy (also making sure the bottles are  good for him and formula that agrees). I (and my wife) have 3 different bottle types,the Medela breastfeeding bottles, the Avent standard/naturals and the Playtex Ventaires. These all fit into this warmer which has an accessory ring to keep them in place although the skinny Medela float/bob around in there a little if there is only 10 or 20 mls of milk in there.Why this warmer is better than others I seen/used:-it feels quality enough. It's not a brick but it doesn't feel like it out shatter if you sneezed on it. Solid enough.- it can be cleaned. Some other models with built in water reservoirs are a bacteria trap. eventually it would need a scrub. This one comes with a removable measure that can be cleaned. The unit itself, you can remove all the baskets (which it comes with a basket for prepared food jars!) and get in there to clean it out.- It turns on with a simple push down on the switch without the whole plug/unplug the cord. Green lights on the conveniently big button lights on and it will automatically shut off when the water you poured in is gone. No more plugging and unplugging. Trust me you will appreciate this button. It's big enough that even I can hit it half asleep no problem! Don't search for a small switch or button when you're half asleep with a crying baby in one arm...that's insane.- Small profile, I would say it has about the footprint of a magic bullet blender. Not bad since the counter lost alot of its space to baby bottle holders/racks etc..- The price..I've seen some crazy prices on some and this certainly is the bang for the buck! I was not buying one for 60+ dollars but I didn't want a cheapo one that broke quick or is more of a hassel to monitor. This was it...winner! Less than 25 dollars, auto shut off, easy to clean, compact enough and warmed well. As everyone else says bottle warming is not an exact science but when you figure your method, you make it as consistent as you can.PRO?CON? - it does shut itself off however there is a learning curve to the amount of water you put into the chamber and how much milk/water is in the bottle. For example, some of the other models adjust temperature by adding more water into the chamber and it just heats a preset time. This unit actually times itself by the amount of time it takes to boil off the water in the chamber. So if you pour in 7 (or less)on the included measure, it will heat up 4 oz water/formula to pretty warm in about 3-4 min max.How do I adjust the temp? - Let's say if I go for 4 oz of formula. I will put a little less than 7 in the measurer into the chamber. Pour in 3 oz of distilled/nursery water only in the bottle. Drop the bottle in the chamber and hit the button. It will shut off by the time I measure the power and put the baby bib on. Take it out, pour my final oz of cold water in and then mix the powder in and it is immediately ready to go. Whatever system works for you but this method instantly brings the mixture down to perfect warmth. The manual and the back of the unit has the handy measure scale in case you need it anyways.Overall, if the baby's tummy is more comfortable because warmer milk is easier for him, then we're happy. I can't complain about the money spent here. It's worth the few more hours of peace and quiet. I hope this helps.UPDATE: use it like mad and it's still working like new. Baby is up to 4oz or more and I find using the minimal line is just fine. By the time you give the water a swirl with the powder and the outside of the bottle is still fairly warm, the remaining coolness of the water inside cancels out the residual outer heat to make it ready to feed immediately. Awesome!UPDATE 9/18/2013: Still rockin and I even ordered another warmer for upstairs. I think it is a great bang for the buck and now with winter creeping around, most definitely will be used like crazy! Again, bottle warming is not an exact science so get that dream out of your head, you just need to figure what works warmer water-to-bottle volume ratio and stick to it. I planned it so once I see him hungry or already crying for it, I pour the water into the warmer, hit the button, pour the water into the bottle - drop the bottle in and start measuring out the formula. By the time I have the scoop loaded and ready, the warming is done and I mix, shake and feed. It really isn't that complicated, just takes some logical planning.

In my case, although there was a warning that a basket should always be used in the warmer, my brain erased that comment with the subsequent paragraph that said wide mouth bottles don't require the lift out basket. To be clearer, in both places it should say that the large basket is always required (otherwise you are heating the bottle directly on the plate and also in boiling water... both of which are no-nos.The instructions are also too simplistic. The type of bottle one uses (shape, size, material) will very dramatically affect how the heat from the steam impacts the solution being heated. I would also imagine that some further tweaking will be required as the composition of breastmilk changes during the day and over the course of the post partum period.For example, I used 9 oz MAM Ultivent (BPA free) translucent bottles that are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. In my successful experiment with water chilled in the fridge to about 40 F, I needed to add 2x the max level in the provided measuring tube to get the water up to about 80 F. The unit was on for about 6 minutes until the water all vaporized. This is more than 2x the amount generally recommended in the instruction sheet and the sticker plastered to the side of the unit has even less detail.Note that if you make the mistake of running the unit without any basket, some overheat sensor will trip before the water is completely used up after about a minute or so.Given that there is unlikely any product out there which monitors the temp of the solution being heated (or is otherwise aware of what kind of bottle/solution combo is in place), trial and error and patience will be required with any such product. Life will probably be easier for formula babies since formula doesn't change over time!Good luck!p.s. a water softener with regular applications of rust-inhibitor solution, or the use of distilled water will probably reduce the amount of cleaning required.

Boy, it will really mix a bottle of formula fast! And no lumps or clots to stick in the nipple. Basically, our son is fed mother's milk, but he's growing fast, has a growing hunger and sometimes mom just can't keep up. So, she pumps milk and we mix a little formula in with her milk to ease the situation. Our boy doesn't like straight formula and grimaces and refuses to consume it (unless he's extremely hungry). However, he'll take a 50/50 mixture of mother's milk and formula without even noticing, so that's what he's getting at times and this little mixer will really churn them together. I have only two dislikes for the mixer. First, it spins so fast and powerful that it foams the milk. So far, this has not been a major problem, especially since I let the mix set a bit, and I'm careful with the mixing so that it isn't overly churned. Second, it is a bit awkward to use in tall bottles. Some reviews have complained of durability problems, but we've had none as yet.I wonder what else I can use a gizmo like this for. Hmmmmm. It might be real good at the bar for fixing small pitchers of martinis. The problem is I don't have a bar and don't drink martinis.

Because his digestive system was still immature, he was extremely difficult to burp, which caused MAJOR gas issues. After going through 2 bottles of Mylicon in the first 2 weeks after he was born, I decided to give these bottles a try. Wow! I saw a difference after the first feeding. I went to burp my son, expecting to spend my usual 15-20 minutes trying to get him to burp, and imagine my surprise after two minutes this HUGE burp came out of this tiny baby! And an hour later, he was happy as a clam, where in the past, he would have his legs pulled up to his chest, in pain from gas.I don't understand what the problem is that people have with cleaning the bottles. So they come with two extra parts...big deal. I hand-wash my bottles, and sterilize them in the dishwasher about once a week, and after the first few washes, the extra parts were a non-issue. I also can't figure out how people can't seem to get the beige vent or the tube clean. Unless you let your bottles sit for days until the forumla gets caked on, a simple soaking in hot water and dish detergent before using the special brush should be all that is needed to keep the vent and the tube clean. If that doesn't work, then you can always boil the pieces for about a minute to sterilize them, without the pieces becoming distorted. I also shake the vents and tubes out after washing to dislodge any water that might be remaining inside the holes. Also, if necessary, I have seen in the Babies R Us store that they sell a 2-pack of vents, as well as a 2-pack of tubes in case the need for new ones arises.My only complaint is that the bottles do leak if they fall on their side for a period of time, so that can be a little tricky when traveling in the diaper bag. I solved that problem by pre-measuring water and putting it into one of my Medela breast pump bottles (which come with lids). Then, while I'm out, I just add formula to the breast pump bottle and shake, then I pour the formula into the empty Dr. Brown's bottle.

(It was different than the ones available online - an 8 oz. wide-mouth bottle)When I stopped breastfeeding I started using 4 oz. Avent bottles for several reasons.  First, because I ended up with 8 of them after purchasing other Avent products and second, because the lactation consultant that taught my breastfeeding class recommended them stating they were more like the breast.When I started looking at purchasing larger 8 oz. bottles I remembered that I had received a Dr. Brown's bottle and decided to try it to see if my daughter would take it.  The wide-mouth nipples look very similar to the Avent ones.  My daughter \"smacks\" a lot when she eats and subsequently takes in a lot of air.  She spit up often and would sometimes spit up what looked like half her bottle when she had trouble burping.  She took the Dr. Brown's bottle instantly and so I decided to buy a few more and switch for a week or two to see if there was any benefit.  I'm so glad that I did!Once I got past the fact that the bottle looked as big as my daughter's head (the 8 oz. wide-mouth bottles are very large!), I realized that she was burping much more easily and hardly spitting up at all.I truly believe the benefits of using this bottle outweigh the extra parts you have to clean.

As the baby sucks on a traditional bottle they have to gradually suck harder and harder as pressure builds in the bottle. This also creates pressure in their ears which can disturb the fluid balance and cause inner ear problems.  The baby also has to frequently break the latch (and the nipple collapses at a certain point of pressure which causes them to unlatch) so that the pressure can equalize in the bottle.  This causes them to take in more air.  Now, when my daughter is really hungry, she can take practically the whole bottle without ever having to break her latch!I really like the nipples as well.  They are much thinner than the Avent ones and mold better to my baby's mouth.  I suppose this is because the Avent ones have to be thicker and stronger to resist collapsing under pressure?Others have stated that leaking is a problem.  They WILL leak only if:1) you heat them without loosening the top (collar/nipple)2) you travel with them without putting the disk in the top designed to keep them from leakingDon't do these things and you shouldn't have any problems.I definitely recommed you at least try these.  I will definitely be purchasing these as shower gifts for new moms!  I do recommend the wide-mouth bottles, though.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best bottle on the market...", "unixReviewTime": 1105315200, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2005"}

We use these bottles almost because my son is an infant and he always has gas. Honestly, though even though its a bit time consuming to clear all the parts I have seen a noticeable difference in these bottles compared to others I have tried, however. like other bottles these also get watermarks and formula smudge on them easily- you can tell when the bottle goes from clear to very blurry looking so you have to clan with soap and water with almost every use. Secondly, you only get one small pipe cleaner brush for the smaller holes in the vented plastic parts inside. So far, I have no had any formula get stuck inside but I still have to clean it, just in case. They are also not as sturdy as some of the other plastic bottles for some reason, the plastic is a little more flimsy and the formula takes a little longer to heat up. The only reason I continue to put up with this is because ever since using these although my sons gas has not completely dissipated, he burps on his own more.

Although I believe she spit up much less with the Dr. Brown system, she ate so slowly that she would only finish half of her bottle and then would fall asleep (she had been drinking 5 oz. and could only finish between 2-3 oz. with the Dr. Brown system).  She would then wake up hungry in 2 hours when she previously was eating every 3 1/2-4 hours!  I have since stopped using the system and now just use different nipples on the tops of these bottles.  It was sort of a waste of money for me but it might be that my daughter is a fussy eater.  She did spit up less so that was a good thing but not worth the small and slow feedings.

It is hard to EXACTLY push the cap down directly onto the nipple and keep the nipple at 90 degrees. The tightness of the fit with the base of the screwtop nipple lock causes it to skew to one side, leaning the nipple...meaning that anytime you turn the bottle with the cap on and the liquid hits the nipple opening, you are prone to have a leak. I've had these caps fill with Similac when the bottle topples over in a diaper bag...try feeding a hungry baby in a mall with a cup full of milk that is about to leak all over everything...not fun...To improve the product, there should be an upside-down saucer-shaped plastic piece in the dead center of the inside of the top of the cap. This would guide the nipple to a perfect position every time, eliminating the problem above.Also, this cap gives you no real grip on the top of the bottle. Avent bottles seem to almost weld themselves shut after a few hours in the fridge. Try opening an Avent bottle with this cap on. About half the time, the condensation on the bottle requires me to take the cap off to get leverage on the Avent screw-on nipple locking ring.

Some work by letting air in from various places (avent-around the threads of the collar, playtex-through tiny perforations in the base), others work by not letting air in at all, but collapsing the container instead (playtex liners...etc). The problem with venting the air through the collar is that it ends up bubbling up and mixing with the formula. The problem with venting through the base is that it requires a bit of force to get the air to go through the perforations - so the bottle builds up negative pressure that resists your baby's sucking. This is the same issue with the collapsible liner bottles - the resistance becomes stronger as the baby finishes the bottle and collapses the liner.Dr. Browns are the only ones that do not mix air with the formula and at the same time do not create any resistance to sucking. This is accomplished by maintaining an open, unobstructed airway to the formula. The tradeoff here is that the bottle will leak if inverted for any period of time or shaken vigorously. I'd say this is a small inconvenience. I guess that the end of the day you don't buy these purely for convenience - you buy them because they're the best for your baby's feeding. Our child was very colicy during her first 3 months. We tried avent, playtex, and others. We got a few Dr browns free at a baby show, and have purchased and used them exclusively since.ps: We were first skeptical with all the parts, but these all wash easily with some creative placement in the dishwasher.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No resistance to sucking", "unixReviewTime": 1119312000, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2005"}

We ended up throwing all other bottles away. I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that. We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything. Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves. I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap). As to some reviewers complaints about leakage, it's true that if the inner tube gets full sometimes the milk can leak out the top - but this has only happened rarely and I've found that if I unscrew the cap and pull out the inner tube then put it back in, the problem is resolved.  The adjustment takes less than a minute and like I said, I've only had it happen once or twice.  Otherwise the bottles, nipples and all the parts are really durable - especially the nipples.  When we first bought the bottles, we bought all these replacement nipples in level 1 and had to return them because we never needed them.  So, my only suggestions are1.  hold off on buying extra nipples to see if you really need them (or at least don't open the package until you need to) and2.  to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles. We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding. So, we had to pack away the 4oz bottles and go out and buy a bunch of the larger size.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Bottles Around!

When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.

Wished I would have found this tub before I purchased one of those hard cold plastic tubs for my newborn. My 4month old outgrew the hard plastic tub by the time he was 3 months old and my husband and I really didn't find it safe for him anymore as he slid under the water twice with one of his Shamu-like back arches, rubbed the skin off of his pinky toe because the tub was too short, and banged his head on either side of the tub countless times with all the flopping around he was doing during his bath, which is more like play time to him. The tub arrived in a timely manner, was priced perfectly, and was ready to go straight out of the box. The first time we used the tub my 4month old fell asleep in it. It is just the right height for his head and arms to rest comfortably on during bath since he isn't able to hold his head up yet. The fact that I can bathe him by myself in the big boy tub and only have one hand on him the whole time rather than both is spectacular since we humans generally only have two hands. Once out of the tub you just drain the water from the big tub, squeeze out as much water from the cushioned tub and hang it up to dry in a well ventilated area. We just hang it from the shower head to drip dry and if needed I transfer it to one of the chairs in our kitchen which is under a ceiling fan to ensure it is completely dry to prevent any mold or mildew growth between baths. This tub makes bathing a slippery and wiggly infant so much easier and safer especially during shampooing and rinsing which I dreaded in his old plastic tub. As we didn't purchase this tub when our child was an infant, I would still highly recommend it for anyone with or about to have a newborn. The plastic tubs and the so called newborn slings are horrible compared to the cushion and ease of use this particular tub provides during bath time. Plus, if you just want to leave your newborn/infant in his/her diaper for a sponge bath it is perfect. Just place the upside down tub on the countertop, lay your child in the bottom cushioned area, and bathe away. Definitely a must have for any first time parent who is intimidated by bath time with their newborn and/or infant.

It worked OK while we still had the sling in it but I have a large son (98% percentile) so he outgrew it very quickly.  The plastic bump in the middle was very inconveniently placed and made bath time difficult for me and uncomfortable for my son.  I order this tub to replace it and with I had gotten this tub first!  It is very versatile and you can use it as a tub or flip it over to use as a sling.  He can lay on his tummy while it's in the sling position making it very easy to actually wash him without having to hold him up with both arms.  He can't sit up by himself yet but the walls are tall enough that he can prop himself up against them, or he can lounge and use the edges as a sort of pillow.  After bath time is over this hangs with a very sturdy hook to dry.  I have been using it 3-4 times a week for just about a month now and have had no problems at all with it getting a musty odor as others have mentioned.  I find that it actually dries fairly quickly.  My only complaint is the sides could have just a little more beads in them so it is not so floppy if the tub isn't filled all the way.  Others have also complained about having to fill the whole tub in order to use this which it true.  It is fabric and will not hold water on it's own but I don't find that to be a problem.  It fills almost the whole tub anyways and I use the extra tub space to float toys for my son to reach for while on his tummy when it's flipped over to be more of a sling/lounge.

We bought it for our first son 2+ years ago and just bought a new one for our new baby. It perfectly and gently cradles the baby in the bathtub so that they cannot squirm out and get submerged in the water or get water in their ears, mouth, etc.  It is angled just enough so that his or her bottom half can be in a good amount of water (no one wants a cold, unhappy baby in the bath). The bather absorbs a lot of water, so if you dunk both sides into the warm water before putting the baby on it, his or her head and back is touching the warm water, which makes it nice.  Also, when you have the baby sit up to wash his hair and back his bum stays in place and he doesn't slide around, which makes bathing such a challenge otherwise.The only negative thing I would say about it (and I don't even really think it's negative) is that after about 1 1/2 years of use, including washing it periodically, it lost some of its shape and wasn't as \"fluffy.\"  That's why we ended up buying a second one, but honestly for the price and use we got out of it, I couldn't complain about it.  Plus by 1-2 years old you don't need it anymore anyways.  It is also important to hang it up in the shower up the hanger provided after use and squeeze the water out or it can become a little bit stinky from mildew.  If you forget it's not a big deal to throw it in the washer.  We washed it periodically anyways, just to keep it fresh.I 100% recommend this product!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect bather for an infant", "unixReviewTime": 1196553600, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2007"}

I had loved the inflatible bathtub I had for her 30 years ago, and the Leachco Safer Bather looked like a significantly improved bath aid.  After using this several times, I can say it has both it pluses and minuses.The bath pad is quite soft and makes an excellent cradle to help hold your infant while bathing.  If you are a first-time parent, then this bath pad will definitely provide you an extra measure of security and allow you to feel more comfortable when bathing your infant.  The pad will sit nicely on a counter; we found it did slide a bit and put some of the waffle-hole padding that one uses to keep rugs from slipping underneath it.  That solved the problem and made the pad sit securely on the counter surface.However, I did not rate this item as five stars for the following reasons.  The cover stains if your baby has an \"accident\" - even laundry stainremover and washing the pad immediately did not prevent this from happening.  Further, the cover picks up any lint in your washer, in addition to pilling some, so it must be washed alone.  I would suggest the manufacturer rethink the fabric on the covering and do something that would prevent immediate staining or provide instructions for removing stains.  A non-pilling fabric would also be much better.The third reason that I did not rate this as five stars is that I believe it has a very limited useful life.  Because it has low sides and the well for the child is not particularly deep, it may not be of much value once your child can sit up.  The inflatible bath tubs have higher sides so that when a child is sitting up, if they happen to tip over, might be able to avoid a nasty head bump.  In the bathing pad, if the child tips over, they could quite possibly hit their head on the side or bottom of the bathtub.I also have concerns that the bath pad may slip when placed in a tub.  The instructions say to soak it, but there are no suction pads on the bottom so that it can adhere to the tub's surface.  The inflatible tubs with which I am familiar do suction to the tub's surface and allow for better infant security.If you have extra funds to spend on your child or grandchild, this might be a good option.  However, I would definitely recommend exploring the various inflatible tubs that are available since they will have a longer useful life and seem to be more secure.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent for New Parents of First-born Children...", "unixReviewTime": 1256083200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2009"}

And they hold the babies so high out of the water, they get cold quick. It was so stiff, I felt like he was going to fall off of it.  I also don't like tubs with baby stoppers in them - the bump that their bottoms sit on to keep them from sliding down.  And the minute the baby starts sitting up, those bumps are uncomfortable for them.  Find a tub that doesn't have a stopper or one that is removable. FP has one in their ocean wonders line.

It wasn't wobbley or anything. It strapped in tight....granted it was a square chair seat and back. Ideal.It was way more sturdy than I thought it was going to be. The base even though inflated with air is sturdy, solid and firm. The frame is not flimsy at all and the straps are nylon.The only two things I noticed:The seat is smaller than I thought it would be. I use them with my 14mo old twins who are also on the small side and they fit perfect. Unless they hit a massive growth spurt and work their way up the percentage chart I could see them using this booster well after 2yrs old.

I used it in supermarkets, the mall, and at home too, when my baby was fussy and wanted to cuddle all the time. It does start hurting your back after a while(30-40 minutes or so), but it didn't bother me that much. The EuroRider has more padding, which helps a lot, but cost twice as much as the CozyRider(we bought it gently used though!!)So, bottom line, this is a great carrier for its price - easy to adjust and our baby loves it. If you plan on hiking or wearing it for longer periods of time, you might want to look into a carrier with more padding(like the Euro Rider or Baby Bjorn). If not, this one will do just fine!!!

But in practice, they're pretty terrible, and I can't for the life of me figure out how the Avent line came to be so hyped.  (A friend of mine speculates it has a lot to do with the cups, bottles, etc being pretty - I'm inclined to agree.)In a way, these cups remind me of the nursery rhyme my mother would chide me with when I was younger, about the little girl with the little curl in the middle of her forehead.  When she was good, she was very, very good - and when she was bad, she was horrid!When these cups are working right, they are wonderful!  But - These cups are STRANGE.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to them.  Sometimes they leak from the spout, sometimes they leak from the collar, but the same cup will not always leak in the same way, if it leaks at all.  Avent bottles have the same leaky collar issue and if you call Avent they will tell you that you must have over-tightened the collar, that the collar is supposed to be tightened using the clear plastic over-cap, not touching the collar directly.  Huh?  Who would think to do it that way?  Why would you put a cap on just to tighten the collar and then remove it?  But it's a moot point because any way I do it, loose or tight, collar or cap to tighten, sometimes they leak, sometimes they don't.All that is after you account for the fact that the larger cups only come with the harder green spouts, which are for toddlers.  This is OK, I suppose...  but the white soft spouts just SEEM nicer, my kid seems to prefer them, and the green spouts are much harder to remove the valves from because they are so stiff!  So when I bought these cups I had to then spend extra money on the white spouts, and that is all we used - which may or may not account for my next problem.  I don't know if it strikes the green spouts or not.Over time, these cups stop working.  You will hand it to your child, he will suck for a bit, get angry, and hand the cup back to you.  You will try the cup.  All you will get is a hiss of air, no liquid.  Early on, you can remove the cap and press harder to snap the valve in place...  but then after a while, nothing works.  You have to replace the caps and valves.  And maybe I'm just an idiot but it bothers me to throw away things that are perfectly OK, and it bothers me that you can't figure out just WHICH part of the cap/valve set has gone bad, you have to either replace all your caps and valves at once or end up playing sippy cup roulette having an odd mixing of new and old spouts/valves that may or may not work when you put them together.In short, this cups have nearly driven me insane.Oh, and my favorite, favorite part about these cups - NOT - is if you use them with the nipple, your kid can push the nipple down inside the cup and spill milk (or whatever) all over the place.  My guy first figured this out while we were out in the stroller and he had a cup of strawberry kefir.  A pretty much full cup.  What a mess!These cups also hold sour milk smell worse than any other cup I have tried (and we've tried a lot)  They pretty much have to be washed in the dishwasher or else repeatedly sterilized which can get annoying.  Of course this can be prevented by washing your cups immediately, every time, but let the mom who has never discovered a squirreled-away sippy full of homemade yogurt cast the first stone...I guess the biggest thing these cups offer over the competition is they have caps.  Most other sippies don't - actually I don't know of any that do.  But we've switched to playtex and I'm pretty happy with them.  No leaks, fewer parts, only one part to go bad...Avent...  ugh.

First you need to untangle the straps, make sure they're going in and coming out of all the right places, THEN you can put your toddler in first and attach the booster to the seat next or vice versa.  The removable tray is nice, but again, a struggle to take off more often than not.  To fold it back down, you'll need both hands once again to push buttons on either side of the seat to pop up the seat and fold it in, then put the tray in with the rest of it, and spend another minute or two \"organizing\" the straps so they don't get tangled up with each other or come apart from the seat itself (even after the straps are \"assembled\" going in and out of all the right places, they just fall back out if you're not really careful).This seat isn't bad for us, we only use it at relatives houses who don't have a booster seat, so it's not too much of a hassle.  (It's only been used a half a dozen times in the past year)  But I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to use it more than once a month.

Before I opened the packet, I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes.  Then, I opened the packet, rolled it into a ball, stuck it between 2 pieces of wax paper, and pressed down on the top sheet of wax paper with a book.  I then put it back in the freezer for 10 minutes before removing the top sheet of wax paper and making the imprint.This trial and error took me 5 tries before I found a process that worked for me:  if you don't put it in the freezer, you can't get the impression material out of the packet.  If you use foil instead of wax paper, the little crinkles in the foil will make creases in the impression material.  I couldn't get the material to a uniform thickness with the roller, so I used a book - it was easier for me to press down once (fairly evenly, since the book was bigger than the material ball) than it was for me to repeatedly roll over the material ball.  (If you do decide to roll, roll on top of the wax paper or the impression material will stick to the roller.)  (Also, make sure it isn't too thick or it will smush against the glass when you frame it.)  If you don't put it back in the freezer, the impression material will stick to your baby's skin.  (I tried lotion and baby powder - separately - as others mentioned, but the impression material still stuck to Dragon Baby.)The instructions say to let dry for 24-36 hours, but it took mine 5 DAYS to fully dry.

Ow", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The molding material is a very sticky foam that results in a very lightweight finished product.  I originally thought it would be more clay-like.  However, it's probably better as foam because it won't put stress on the adhesive tape that holds it into the frame.I consider myself a pretty crafty person and strive to make things look perfect, but it was extremely difficult to work with.  I read many of the Amazon reviews for tips (thanks!) and used the wax paper instead of foil (one piece for the top side, one for the bottom), and a cutting board instead of wooden roller to press the foam flat.  The foam still stuck to the wax paper in some areas, despite kneading the foam for a while.  The foam stuck in certain areas, primarily around the edges, which get cut off.  But sometimes, it stuck to the whole surface area. There was no rhyme or reason to the way it stuck, I just had to try a few times.  Then when I used a cutting board to press the foam flat, some of the cuts in the cutting board showed up in the foam.  Instead, I used the bottom of a plate (that doesn't have a rim) to flatten it out.  It still produced some wrinkles some of the time.Used a bit of lotion on the baby's foot and it did not stick to the foam at all.It was very hard to cut out a rectangle in the foam and produce a clean edge.  Using the ruler, I pressed down to make the cut, then slid the ruler along the length of the cut to avoid pulling out the foam along the bottom edge of the cut.  Hard to explain.  A bit of touchup with fingers will help, but there is no way you can expect perfection and that annoys me.When it was all done, a piece of black lint stuck to the middle of the footprint.  Ugh!  Too much effort to re-do it all, so it'll stay there permanently.Dried the foam face up for maybe 15 hours, leaving the bottom-side wax paper on.  Then peeled the bottom-side wax paper off and dried the bottom.  I agree that if you don't flip it, the mold will curl/warp.  After I flipped it and dried it, it's relatively flat.  Used scissors to trim off some roughness on the cut edge.  An x-acto knife did not work to clean up the edges because it's foam.  I really do think that 48 hrs or more of drying is necessary.  When I handled it after maybe 42 hours, it wasn't really done.Frame is OK.  Not the best, but acceptable.  I wish it came with a more neutral colored mat to go behind the footprint.  I have a girl, but the pink looks tacky, so I'll use the blue... or maybe I'll replace it with a mat of my own color choice.All-in-all a bit of a pain to work with, but so nice to have a (hopefully) permanent imprint of my baby's foot at 1 month of age.

The instructions tell you to roll it in aluminum foil. It stuck to the foil and repeatedly stuck to my son's foot (see additional uploaded photos) regardless of how thick or thin it was rolled out. What finally worked was to roll it between wax paper, let the clay dry for 5-10 minutes after you roll the material before you try to make an impression (this was not included in the instructions).  I only found this out after we had already made about a dozen attempts and decided to use the scraps to experiment to make a hand print. Because we re-rolled the clay so many times, lint and dirt started to get embedded into the clay resulting in an unattractive print that we didn't want to frame.3) I would have expected a little form to keep the clay in a nice square/rectangle, cutting it with the supplied ruler was also a mess that stuck and deformed the print.  After a day, the clay still did not completely dry and has the consistency of the stiffer marshmallows from Lucky Charms (firm but will dent with pressure).4)  There is nothing special about the frame except it is thicker.  To attach the clay they include double sided tape.I would not recommend this product.  For the price you can easily go to a craft store and procure the same materials and have a much better end result.  Personally, I would use artist clay to make a foot/hand impression first and cast that in plaster.Update: 30 November 2011I contacted Pearhead regarding the difficult time we had with the clay and that it was embedded with lint and stuff from being re-rolled. They responded in less than 12 hours and said that they would send out more clay to us. I originally rated this product as a 1, but because they had excellent customer service I wanted to upgrade my rating to between a 2 and a 3.Update: 02 January 2012Since my last update, they did not send replacement clay. I have since emailed the company two or three times and have received no response. I now would like to reduce the rating of this product to a zero if that were possible.Update: Jan 2013It seems that they did not like my picture I had uploaded of my newborn son's feet stuck in the clay gunk and pulled down the picture from the site. Instead of fixing the product or providing customer service, it seems that they prefer to hide the imperfections with the product so that more people will buy it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Very poor quality for the amount you pay", "unixReviewTime": 1321920000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2011"}

Our son recently turned two and we still have the kit on-hand for almost daily use.The best items include*  the well-designed medicine spoon:  It stands upright on its own so you can pour liquids into it and see how much you've dispensed;  the guidelines are metric on one side and English on the other;  the spoon itself is sized well for baby with little to no mess* the nail clippers:  Big handle for sure gripping while holding a potentially squirmy customer* the bath thermometer:  Much more accurate than so many other bath toys that try to do double duty as a thermometer).The most disappointing component was predictably the thermometer.  It's a pretty simplistic digital model that needed to be held in place too long to get very accurate readings from a baby.  My wife and I use it ourselves and it works fine.  If your baby tends to get a lot of fevers, invest in a high-end ear or forehead thermometer for the best combination of accuracy and speed.  The toothbrush is also not very helpful because by the time baby is ready to begin brushing, he or she will want a less clinical-looking model with a smaller, softer head than this one has.One note on the negative review at the top of the page:  maybe everyone should move to Ann Arbor, MI before delivering because the hospitals and pharmacies are much more liberal with their giveaways there.  We loved our hospital experience, but our parting gifts consisted of a bulb aspirator (which wasn't as nice as the one in this kit), a pat on the back and a \"have a nice day now\".  Leaving the hospital and coming home with a newborn, especially your first, can be an unbelievably hectic time - I wouldn't want to rely on the possibility of freebies to help us take care of our baby.Given the low cost of this kit, it's well worth knowing that you're prepared to come home with your newborn.

But the truth is you won't need most of it.Let's start with nail care.  The clippers in this set are adult size with a neat little handle added.  Well adult size is too big to use on those little bitty hands...that is why they back infant sizes.  Those nails are also so soft the first couple of years that you won't be able to use the scissors or files on them.  I ended up using the files and we use the scissors to cut tags off of new outfits.Then you have all medical stuff.  The nasal aspirator in this set doesn't work.  None you will ever buy will work as well as the one they give you in the hospital.  Keep all the free stuff from the hospital because 99% of it is better than what you can buy.  This also goes for the thermometer.  They will be taking your babies temp frequently after birth and they use a digital unit similar to this one but better.  The one we got at the hospital works in 3-5 seconds.  Another reviewer said to get an ear unit.  Don't waste you money.  They are inaccurate and the doctor will not take readings form them.We still haven't used the medicine spoon or dropper.  If you child needs medication it will come with a syringe which is quiet frankly easier to use then a dropper.  And at 14 months our daughter still can't take any medication from a spoon.  Our doctor said that usually doesn't happen until 3 years of age.Then there were the tweezers in this set...in 14 months we still have not figured out what these things are for!  You've also got the toothbrush.  It's far too big for a toddler mouth and you can't use it until they are at very least a year old.  the bristles are also more like that of an adult toothbrush.  So this was added to our stash of cleaning brushes.So what have we used of this set...the brush.  The comb still makes her cry (it scratches her head) and gets tangled very easily in her curly hair.

I dont know anyone who would enjoy turning a knob fifty times to get a new bag, one handed, are you kidding me? Okay so that one was history. There were 2 others I was looking at, the Diaper Champ, and the Neat Diaper Disposal System, yes this one wasnt in mind just yet. My friend has ONE 10 month old and her Champ STINKS. But since she really doesnt know any others I told her that if the other pails sucked too, than I would just get that one. Well now the neat, we didnt buy it, we saw it at a friends house who HATED her Champ, well now she HATES the neat. she has a 3 month old and an 18 month old. So I didnt know what to do. I was leaning toward the champ because if all of them stunk, atleast this one didnt need refils. Well at BRU there was a disposal system I didnt see before, low and behold.... THE DEKOR PLUS! I told my husband that all of the other ones stunk, so lets just try this one, we could say we tried them all! Well, for the occasional 3 year old pull ups, and 2x the dirty 8 month old diapers... I LOVE IT! This thing is just so nifty. It really keeps the smell at bay, until of course when you empty it. I keep one of those circular deoderant things attatched (sometimes 2!) and I spray it with lysol when I CLEAN it out, every 2 weeks or so. And When I empty it the smell is no worse than a regular dirty diaper smell. Well I do sometimes get a little whift of it in the boys room, but than I JUST CHANGE THE BAG! Duhh, if it starts to smell just change it more often. I am sorry but diapers STINK and I found that the Diaper Dekor is the best. My friends have K.O the champ and wished away of their diaper genies.

Honestly, I originally wanted this one because it looked nicer than the other pails, and the white and grey went with our nursery. However, now that we've been using it for 6 months, I really love how function it is.Pros:-No smell. I empty this thing maybe once a week (sometimes longer if I'm lazy) and I never smell the dirty diapers. We are into eating solids now, too ... and if you have a baby you know what I'm talking about.-Easy to empty. I love that I can just open the bottom, pull the bag out, cut it off, and the new bag is already loaded and waiting. The bags also hold a lot of diapers. I haven't counted, so I can't tell you exactly how many, but like I mentioned above, I only empty it once a week.-Locking lid. There's a lock on the lid to prevent little hands from getting into the trash. Our baby is only 6 months so I haven't had to worry about this yet, but she's crawling and into everything, so I'm sure it's not far off.-Looks nice. It really does look like a nice diaper pail. Also, the narrow width makes it perfect to fit between our dresser/changing table and the wall.-Refills last forever. The refills are pricier than some others, I'm sure, but they last forever. I've only replaced the bag once and that was around 3-4 months.Cons:-No indicator of when the bag refill is close to the end of the roll. This is really my only complaint. I think I read a review somewhere that suggested putting a pink line or some marker on the refill bags so you know when it's almost out. It hasn't caused me any problems yet, but it would be helpful to know when I'm almost out of bag.-The lid sticks up sometimes, and doesn't close all the way. I'm not sure if this is because it's sitting on plush carpet and not on a hard surface or what, but the lid doesn't always fully shut. Not a big deal because there's a second lid underneath that covers the diapers, but it's an annoyance.

I think they were the first to come out with a diaper disposal system, since the name \"Diaper Genie\" is to diapers as Xerox is to copiers.Unfortunately, the Diaper Genie is a terribly designed product (this from an engineer).

You drop the diaper in and you're finished.As emptying it, it's as simple as trying to knots.  Trust me, it takes 30 seconds maximum to empty it.

Let's face it - leave dirty diapers in a warm room for a week or more, and it WILL smell.There IS one poor aspect to the Diaper Dekor - you'll read about it in every review...  The door that you open to empty it is NOT child resistant.  In reality, it is a child-magnet.I found a clean solution to the problem, but it is a shame we have to do this.  Go to Home Depot, and buy a roll of the BLUE painter's masking tape.  It is in the paint section, and looke like a roll of masking tape, but it's blue.  Buy the 1 1/2\" width.Put a strip over the recessed knob, and the kids won't be able to open the DIaper Dekor.  The reason you want the blue stuff is that it can be pulled off and WON'T leave any sticky.You could also simply put the Diaper Dekor on a shelf, and use your hand to open the top lid before dropping in a diaper.Either way, this gets 4 stars compared to the 0 star Diaper Genie.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Blows away the Diaper Genie", "unixReviewTime": 1088985600, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2004"}

As others have mentioned, this is essentially a traditional step-action garbage can, with an additional door/flap to hold in the smell. That flap helps a lot - it means that as the lid is opened, it isn't pulling \"dirty\" air up from the can's interior, so that definitely cuts down on the odor spread.The biggest issue we have with it, however, are the refills - they don't last the longest and they give no warning when they're about to run out.  If you're not careful, this could make for a baaaad day - the refills come as a long tube of bag which you pull down and tie on the bottom, cutting the top and retying it each time you want to empty the bin. If you're lazy and don't pull the newly tied/clean/empty bag section down all the way, you might not realize that there are only a few inches left - which will cause the bag to fall to the bottom, open, when the contents get heavy enough. That's bad on its own, but if unnoticed, you could easily fill the container, without the bag in place, and have a nasty, smelly surprise waiting for you.  It hasn't happened to us, but it came close.The fix would just to be to have some sort of warning/indicator to show when the refill roll is about to run out.

The changing station we use most often is the one that attaches to his pack and play in our bedroom, and so this disposal system is in our bedroom all the time. I have never, even at it's fullest, noticed a smell from it, and my husband has likened me to a bloodhound for my ridiculously sensitive sense of smell. Bear in mind though, that my son is not yet on solids, and his poop is still just glorified bile. I will update this review in a few months when he has really stinky diapers. The only time you will smell it is when you are tying up the bag when it's full, but that's when the whole system is open and you're smelling old poop from a couple of days ago. That has to be expected.It holds a lot, we empty it about twice a week, and the refill cartridges last for AGES! We have used it for 3 months, about 8 or 9 diapers a day (since my son has an INCREDIBLE knack of pooping before, during and after we change him) and we are only about half way through our second cartridge in total. Like other reviewers, I would say they could do with putting a red strip at the end of the refill to let you know you're about to need to put a new one in, but you'd always have your next one ready to go anyway. The door latch isn't very strong, and so the door can open ajar when the bag is quite full and bulging, but again, you'd be changing it by that point anyway, and that would allow the door to close properly again.It's a good price. The refills are not expensive, especially for how long they last. I'd definitely get it again.EDIT: My son is now 7 months old and well and truly on solids with the stinky poop that goes with that. The system is also 7 months old, but all the springs and latches seem as strong as they were to begin with. Sadly, there is a bit of an odor to this system now, and I tend to keep it out in the hallway instead of by the changing station in his room, just so the smell isn't enclosed in one small room all the time. Out there, I honestly don't smell it unless I'm right up close to it, and don't feel the need to hide it when we have guests over.I absolutely stand by my 4 stars. It is a good system, and I would purchase it again. You really need to remember what these systems are for, and that there will always be some degree of smell leakage from any diaper disposal system.

Pros: easy to use and change the bag. Cons: the smell! Every time I throw a diaper in there, the 1 second it takes for the diaper to enter the compartment is enough to release a foul odor!

Only smells when you toss a diaper in.Also, if you want to throw away just a diaper wipe, you can't because the 'trap door' requires pressure (from the weight of a used diaper or your hand) in order to enter the trash compartment.

I did so much research when making my baby registry on this piece of equipment for her nursery because there are just so many options out there and so many people with different opinions. Let me explain why I love this system the most:- Foot lever to open the lid makes it easy to keep one hand on baby and drop the diaper in without a hassle.- Lid to the diaper storage area takes minimal effort to push it down and drop the diaper in, but it is also LOCKABLE for when baby gets older and starts to \"explore\" their nursery.- Top lid drops down securely and so you actually have two barriers between the bag of diapers and the air of the nursery so I've never smelled anything.- Inside there's the never-ending stream of plastic which serves as the diaper bag and I have found this to be so effective, when it comes time to change the bag I can compress the diapers and cut the plastic using the inside cutter to maximize the bag use. (See note below for comment on bags)- Stylish design makes it very un-obtrusive in the nursery. It didn't come covered in bright colored, garish stickers and advertisements. I was able to take it out of the box and immediately start using it. It also came pre-loaded with diapers!- Compared to the Diaper Genie which you have to press the diapers through a tight seal (and diapers can thus explode all over you) this is so much better and easier to use. My husband is very happy with it and not bothered at all in using it. I've had friends (and especially friends' husbands) complain about the diaper genie because of the issue of having to press the diapers through a seal.Side note: I highly recommend using the original refillsDiaper Dekor Plus Refills 2 Packbecause they do a lot to help with the odor control.

Again, not too bad, but no it does NOT work as well as the genie. However, the big \"pro\" to this pail is that you do not HAVE to buy the refills. I actually did buy the refills a couple of times, but came to hate them because when they run out they wouldn't always obviously \"stop\" like the genie and on more than one occasion I went to empty the pail to find a collapsed bag with a bunch of loose dirty diapers inside. Boy did that make me mad. Now, I simply use cheap 13 gallon kitchen size trash bags (or medium size would work also I believe) and it's very easy to fit them in this pail...tuck it around the top ridge and it won't collapse and it's cheaper than using genie replacements (it holds more than a genie too).In summary, if you buy one pail only, the genie is still the best, you just have to suck up the cost of refills. This makes a great secondary pail for wet diapers. I might also buy a second of THIS pail to keep downstairs for the few diapers we change down there, and to ensure the dogs don't get in the trash which happened a time or two.

This diaper pail is wonderful!  In the months that we have had it, we have never had a problem with smell.  It fits MANY diapers as well--I find that we have to change it only once every 4-5 days.  The refill pack comes with three refills and each refill lasts us about 2 months.  There is no complicated stuffing and twisting like there is with the other diaper pails (that I have heard from friends do not work as well with keeping smell out of the nursery--ie. Diaper Champ and Diaper Genie).  Using it is as simple as pressing the foot pedal and dropping in the diaper.  I do have to admit that when the pail gets a little full, we tend to pack the diapers down so that the bags will last longer, but I have never had a problem with getting anything on my hands.  The only issue I have with this is that I have it on carpet, and it can be difficult to use the foot pedal because of this (wants to sink into the carpet).  But all I do is simply lift up the lid and drop the diaper in--no problems!  It is very nice looking as well--does not look like a diaper pail, so it could be used as a garbage can in the future (the top diaper drop part comes out so that it can be used for just this reason).

I shopped around for a repair kit and came up empty, so emailed the company. They quickly -- and gratis -- sent out a replacement flapper door that easily snapped into place.

So many of my friends tried Diaper Genie and others and claimed that no diaper disposal system really keeps out the smell or works very well. I found that the claims Diaper Dekor makes are true. It is very easy to dispose of the bag when it is full and there is no diaper odor in my daughter's nursery. So nice to find a product that delivers on its claims.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best diaper pail out there", "unixReviewTime": 1096502400, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2004"}

We keep this in the bathroom because after a while it stinks - we are on our second one - the first lasted us a year and then it smelled so bad even after being cleaned extensively many, many, many times we just threw it out and bought another one. We've tried others as well and have concluded this one is the best and by far the easiest to use (just step on the lever it and throw the diaper in) - I want the least amount of interaction with the contents as possible and this diaper pail fills that bill. p.s. Here is a tip: buy a Stick up air freshener and stick it inside the diaper pail (on the wall of the pail where the diapers go) this won't completely alleviate the smell but it will help and also spray it frequently with lysol.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "None of them are too great but this one is better than most....", "unixReviewTime": 1133913600, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2005"}

Like most trash cans, you step on the pedal to open the lid. A smaller, spring loaded interior lid keeps the diapers out of sight. When you want to toss your diapers, you open the front side of the unit, cinch the bag at the top, and cut it on the safety blade inside. You then tie a knot on the bag you just cut, and another to start a new bag, and you're done. This feature seems a little gimmicky. You could easily have a bag dispenser inside with individually cut bags, the way they do produce bags at the supermarket, so you wouldn't have to cut and tie each time. That said, it still works.Now that our baby is growing up, however, we've been using our Dekor less and less. The Dekor doesn't do a great job eliminating odors, and that's starting to become a problem. Who wants their nursery to smell like poop? And since they're bigger now, the Dekor also doesn't hold as many diapers as it used to. So instead of using the Dekor, we've been using our regular trash cans instead and emptying them out more often.From what I've read, it seems like the Diaper Genie does a better job eliminating odors. If I had the chance to do it all over again, I think I'd try one of those instead.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Our thoughts after 12 months", "unixReviewTime": 1383350400, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2013"}

I read a few other reviews and would like to comment based on them.Our son will be 5 months old this week. He was exclusively breastfed, then had formula added to his diet, and now also eats jarred foods. Regardless of what he eats and what his \"output\" is, as long as you close the diaper the way you should, this pail holds in odors just as well as any other diaper disposal system does.I personally think the design is ingenious! The liner sets in the top of the pail and you pull it through to the bottom and make a knot in the bottom. To dispose of the diapers, you just step on a pedal. The top lifts up, you drop the diaper, and it falls through the \"flaps.\" When it's full, you open the door on the front and cut the liner off (there is a liner-cutter in the door). You are totally in control of how much liner you use and therefore don't have to waste or have a huge portion of liner that is unfilled. Then you just tie a new knot and pull the liner down to fill the pail, and you're ready to start again! The system comes with one liner refill, and refills are sold 3 to a pack (I see them all the time at my Babies 'R' Us, and my Babies 'R' Us almost never has anything in stock!). We are on the first refill in the first pack. We had bought 2 packs of refills when we got the system, and I seriously wonder if we will ever need to purchase another one...or if we'll even use all of what we bought!One reviewer stated that the system should tell you when the bag is about to run out because you could be tossing your diaper into the pail w/out a liner. I'm really not sure how that would ever happen, as you are the one who has to open the side of the pail to remove the full bag and pull down the new liner. If you go to pull down the liner and it you hit the end of the refill...well, it's like saying you don't know when your paper towel roll comes to an end. You pull and there is no more.Someone also commented on the flaps, and how the diapers don't fall through. I disagree with that. Regardless of my son's age, as long as he urinated more than once in his diaper and there was any kind of weight to it at all, it would fall through. Only if it was completely dry would it not fall through. And even then, if you just take your foot off the pedal and let the top fall down, it would push it through anyway. The one area I do agree with that person in, though, is that when the pail starts filling up, if you really want to maximize the liner and not change it right away, you DO have to push down on the top diaper to get it to go down far enough for the flaps to close again. But I have never touched another dirty diaper doing this, and I think that it's still worth not having to reach down and lift and push and twist, like you do with the Diaper Genie.There were also comments on refilling the liner. No, it is not as simple as dropping a bag in, like you would a regular trash can. But it most certainly is not complicated. There is a drawing that shows you how to do it, and once it's done, you won't be doing it again for months. Also, when you change the liner, it is SO easy to take the top pieces apart to clean them. I think it's very easy to keep this system clean & sanitary.All that said, if you're looking for the easiest possible route to dispose of dirty diapers, use your regular garbabe can and take the trash out frequently! If you're looking for a disposal system so you don't have to worry about constantly getting dirty diapers out of your house, I'd really have to say this one is the way to go!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product; wouldn't buy any other kind!", "unixReviewTime": 1139184000, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2006"}
