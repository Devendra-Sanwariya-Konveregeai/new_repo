Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer.

However, I will say that this is a much better than average tasting sports bar/snack (name your preference), free of the cardboad-ish and stale texture and barely identifiable aftertastes common to similar products.While noone will compare this to a real apple crisp, this convenient food for those on the go has recognizable tastes of oats (this flavor and texture predominates), apple, and cinnamon, due in large part, I suspect, to the fact that it actually contains those ingredients!

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.

She took one look at my coffee-making operation and shook her head in disbelief. I needed a high-end coffeemaker. This just wouldn't do!

It was good equipment and made a good cup of coffee, although the cost of the equipment was over 7 times that of my Melitta and the coffee wasn't as good. Plus, the equipment had to be meticulously cleaned and that quickly turned into an onerous task. My old Melitta was relegated to camping duties and finally lost.Well, my wife is now gone. And I was about to clean the Cuisineart Coffeemaker for the umpteenth time. I came up with the brilliant idea of going back to a Melitta. Good move! They were still around. I couldn't spot them in stores, but they were available on Amazon. What a neat gadget! I used it this morning and the coffee tasted so good! And it was so simple!

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.> If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.> It is easy to brew  exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds. You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.> In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\". It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there. You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open. If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.  It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components---just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough.  Caveat--some types of coffee are oiler than others---you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient.SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the \"6 cup\" and \"10 cup\" systems can nominally hold 6 or 10 cups off coffee (filled to the brim), but that is really irrelevant.  A more important consideration is cups vs mugs.  How many people still drink \"cups\" of coffee?  So, it is the \"mug-capacity\" (1 mug = 1 1/2 cups) of the filters and cones which really counts.#2 filters/conesRecomemnded: 1 cupPractical Maximum: 1 mugTheoretical Maximum: 2 cups#4 filters/cones (\"6 cup system\")Recommended: 1-2 mugsPractical Maximum:  2 1/2 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 4 mugs#6 filters/cones (\"10 cup system\")Recommended: 2-3 mugsPractical Maximum: 4 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 6 mugsHowever, I don't follow my own recommendation:  In the morning, I want coffee \"now!\"  I often run out of patience trying to brew even 1 mug of coffee using #4 filter/cones.  On the other hand, the #6 filter/cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour, and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in---so I find it very convenient for brewing 1 to 2 mugs of coffee at a time, and on rare occasions to easily brew 4 mugs (6 cups) of coffee.  However, in this case, the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee.  To compensate, I grind my coffee very finely.  I could simply use more coffee, but that would be wasteful.The #6 filters/cones (\"10-cup system\") is faster and more flexible, at a slightly higher cost for the filters.Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup, 1-CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited, such as in a camper, boat, or in a college dorm, or if you really want only 1 or 2 mugs of coffee at a time, #4 filter/cones (the so-called \"6 cup system\") is a good choice.GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the \"recommended\" or fewer number of mugs of coffee, then very-finely ground coffee is recommended. If you usually brew the the \"recommended\" or more number of mugs at a time, then a medium grind coffee may work best.  Most supermarket \"fine grind\" is actually a medium grind.  If you brew more than the \"practical maximum\" a medium-coarse grind will work better.  If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder, \"coarse\" is only a second or two, medium-fine is perhaps 10 seconds, and very fine is perhaps 30 seconds, until the pitch of the sound changes, indicating that no more grinding is taking place.REUSEIf you use very-fine grind, then discard the used filter when finished (because most of the flavor will be extracted, and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds).  If you use a medium grind, then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee (which will be lower in caffeine).  Coffee-freaks may object to reusing grinds, but it works just fine.FORMULARegardless of the grind, you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made, i.e., 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per mug, depending on your taste, brand, etc.FILTERSPresumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.  Unfortunately, #6 filters are hard to find in most grocery stores, but easy to purchase via Amazon.Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, White, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)In an emergency, you can use #4 filters in a #6 cone, but you'll regret it (having been spoiled by the convenience of #6 filters).RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE>>Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible.  Do not use \"softened\", \"sparkling\", or \"mineral\" water.  If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours (or overnight), most of the chlorine will evaporate.  The best way to get pure water is a reverse-osmosis system.  Bring the water to a quick boil, but don't leave it boiling too long--that will flush out the dissolved oxygen, leaving the coffee tasting flat.>>There is a huge difference between brands and roasts.  Experiment and enjoy.  However, even more important is freshness---which is the greatest challenge.  How can you know if the coffee is fresh?  The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia, Boca Java, or Coffee Bean Direct--whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted (and freshly-ground if you wish) coffee.>>Particularly if you do not use a \"coffee service\", its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing.  A $15 grinderKrups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Blackis as good as a $200 grinder. It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil.>>For newbies, \"French\" or \"dark roast\" coffee is rich and bitter, and usually brewed \"strong\".  Light roasts are more complex, but some are acidic, and are usually brewed and drank more like tea.  Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex.  Caveat, \"complex\" does not necessarily mean flavorful---some dark roasts are wonderful, but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast.  TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee.>>The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use, otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils. A weekly wash in the dishwasher won't hurt.>>Elsewhere, you'll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature, how fast or how slow to pour the water, the value of porcelain vs plastic cones, preheating the cones with hot water, how finely ground the coffee should be, etc.  It's all nonsense (except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers). 99% of what matters is the quality of the ingredients: water and coffee.  You want fresh oxygenated chlorine-free salt-free water, and good quality recently-roasted and recently-ground coffee.SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove.  I broke at least 6 carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee.  The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop, or put out a the flame of a gas stove---both causing catastrophic problems.  Use your microwave to reheat (1 mug of coffee = 30-45 seconds); it's faster and safer.It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone. It is any easy accident to make. To minimize such accidents, fold over the \"joined\" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider. If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can \"glue\" the filter to the cone.SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE?Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black.  While I tentatively agree, I can't.  My taste-buds are overly sensitive to bitterness.  However, I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 ozis a good replacement for sugar for me.  Oddly, it isn't as sweet as sugar, but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness, which is what I really need.  Truvia and other brands in packets or described as \"spoonable\" contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue, and are comparatively expensive.  KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical.SALT IN YOUR COFFEE?It's a naval tradition.  I've found that a few grains of sea-salt in a cup of light-roast coffee can be pleasant, but not so compelling that I make a habit of it.  However, a little salt is more noticeable (in a good way) in ice coffee.MILK IN YOUR COFFEE?If the purpose is just to cut the acidity, then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method.  If the purpose is to cut the bitterness, you might want to try stevia instead.  If you simply like milk in your coffee---I say, indulge yourself with a little real (not fake) half-and-half, or even heavy cream.  I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia, but for a rare desert cup, real sugar and real cream are essential.GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1307404800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2011"}

The problem, the espresso machines would scale up and either need cleaning (descaling) or blow the safety valve in the lid and be rendered useless.  We have gone through countless steam espresso machines over the years and spent many a Saturday (yes, the whole day) soaking the espresso machine in descaling solution and then cleaning the descaling solution out of the espresso machine so the first cup in the morning, wouldn't taste like descaling solution.Well, we can no longer find.....anywhere, basic steam espresso machines as all we can find are fancy espresso machines that will quickly clog up with scale or drip coffee makers that churn out weak, watery coffee shop style coffee.....\"More coffee hun?\"  Do you really want to know?Enters this drip carafe as I tried making drip coffee out of a paper towel and a strainer and found the coffee to be acceptable but still a bit bitter and not up to par.  I ordered up this carafe with six hundred #4 filters at less than one-third the cost of what a replacement steam espresso coffee maker would have cost, based upon the last purchase price of eighty dollars US.Yes, it's a bit of a \"BIG\" pain to make a carafe of coffee.  The water needs to be heated in a microwave, two cups at a time for four minutes and then slowly drizzled over the fresh grinds until all the water has been allowed to drain through the filter.  This needs to be done twice, using three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground, French Roast, coffee beans, in each of two filter baskets.The good, now that's what I'm talking about!  The resulting coffee is fresh, thick, robust, smooth, full flavor, that's what I'm talking about, coffee.  The point, if you care about your coffee and how it tastes, for the effort, this is for you.  We drink our coffee black and do not find need to add creams, sugars or otherwise to make it palpable as we like our coffee in the morning, just as it is, perfectly black.An aside, we buy filters, six hundred filters at a time.  We use three to four filters each morning as we brew up coffee at the rate of sixteen ounces per three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground coffee, per filter.  Doing the math, this is about a six month supply of coffee filters.If you're looking for convenience, dash and go, this is not for you.  If you're looking to have fresh, smooth, robust coffee in the morning and don't mind the hassle it takes to get what you want, this package is definitely for you.---------------------Addendum:I like this combination so much that today, 10Aug13, I purchased a second pot/filter cone combination.  FYI, the coffee is the best morning coffee we've had.  We are very happy with the coffee this hand pour drip system makes.  It's a bit slow working with a single filter cone so in a few days, we'll have a second pot/filter cone to speed the morning coffee making process up.

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.It is easy to brew exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds.  You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.  I often re-use the morning's grinds in the afternoon, by adding a spoon of decaffeinated coffee.  That is not recommended with an automatic coffee machine---because if you clog up the filter, the boiling water could overflow.  No problem clogging up a Melitta filter, if it drains slowly, then pour slowly.In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\".  It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there.  You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open.  If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.Although most people use smaller Mellita filters and cones, I prefer the large #6 system.  The #6 system (filters, cone, and caraf) is intended for brewing 4-8 cups at a time.  However, the larger filter holds more water, and it drains faster, so you can brew 2 cups of coffee with a #6 filter faster than with a #4 filter.  So the #6 system is faster and more flexible, at a very slightly higher cost for the filters.If you grind your own coffee, the water (for 1-2 cups) is almost boiling by the time you've set up the filter, ground the coffee, and put away the coffee grinder.  A #6 filter actually holds the water for about 2 cups of coffee, but drains so fast that pouring 4-8 cups of water through just takes perhaps 10--15 seconds.  The corresponding #6 glass carafe is marked for up to 8 cups, but obviously it takes longer to boil the water for 8 or so cups of coffee.It's as simple as it gets, the price of the filters is cheap, and the quality of the results as terrific.  What else could you want?Presumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.The specific Amazon product is probably the cheapest way to purchase the preferred filters.NOTEIt is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone.

I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads, and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste. Also, it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice' up your meal (pun intended) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick.

I told her to send it back if there's anything wrong with it, but she said no, it is PERFECT.  Knowing my mom, she would have told me if it wasn't.UPDATE:  I've had three trees sent as gifts to family and they have been an absolute hit!

They will offer you insanely hot sauces, that aren't really sauces because they're simply pure extract.  Anyone can make extract that'll make your rectum erupt, but to make a sauce that is actually flavorful is the kicker.  The closest sauce to Dave's Insanity would probably be After Death.  The spice level is pretty similar, but Blair's has a grainy, almost sandy texture to it that kind of eats away at your palette.

It's one of those sauces that you can put a little on a toothpick and watch someone's face light up as the heat arrives.  So when I saw that Dave's had a Ghost Pepper based sauce I was excited to see just what it was going to bring to the table.  The answer is pure smokey heat.The first time I tried it I was very sparing with it, putting just a couple of drops on a few slices of pizza and spreading them out.  The result was that I could taste the heat but not really the flavor of the sauce.  The next time I decided to just sprinkle 8 to 10 drops of the sauce over a few slices and I got the full throttled effect.  The sauce is hot, make no mistake about that.  It starts out hot and continues to linger, allowing each additional bite to add to the burn.  A nice greasy, cheesy pizza is the perfect delivery method as the fats in the cheese try to keep your tongue from burning up, but to no avail as it is just temporary relief.  I found each bite to get hotter and the sweat started to pour.  The amazing thing to me was that even with the heat level I was still enjoying the taste of the pizza and the sauce.The bottom line is if you like hot sauce HOT, this is good stuff.

Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick.

I only recently bought a \"hottest sauce\" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Kick to it", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the \"Ghost Pepper\" because after one bite of the pepper you \"give up the ghost\".Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration.

Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the \"coffee crisis\" of 1976-9.\" Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk, and sugar added as desired.

We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).Pefect patries and heavenly coffee.

Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.

So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat.

While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.A better choice would be the El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce.

It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it.  Also, the color is fabulous.  I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green.  Love it.My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch.  The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Addictive", "unixReviewTime": 1342051200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2012"}

But I settled for trying to warm up.I've always heard that if you warm up on the inside, then the outside will follow. So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm. When I was done shoveling and still shivering, I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.First, a few words about the taste: El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element, lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond. The additional spices play well with the primary pepper, adding a savory depth that's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt. The tomato base and hearty thick texture promise a richness and complexity of flavor that is delivered quite nicely to the palate.And now, a few words about the unrelenting napalm burn that traveled around my mouth, down my gullet and -- over the next twelve hours or so -- into, through, and out my intestines, scorching and defiling every square millimeter of delicate insides that it touched: [...]Overall, I'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes, as well as grilled meats, starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to, say, garlicky green veggie side dishes.

I've been blind taste testing hot sauces for over 6 months. I have about 40 hot sauces in my house. I taste test them raw, and then with food; write up some notes and then a week or so later do the same thing again and then compare all my notes. I repeat this process again and again. Like I said: everyone needs a hobby. Frankly I wanted to settle on a few excellent brands because I love hot foods. So for about $75.00 I have a cabinet filled with hot sauces.The first thing that everyone needs to know is that a Chipotle based hot sauce is a sub-category within the hot sauce universe. The chipotle is a smoked jalape&ntilde;o&ntilde;o pepper, relatively mild and it has a rich, almost sweet flavor, and it is not that hot. I happen to love its taste but I have discovered there are a number of inferior sauces based on this pepper.The El Yucateco is at the very top of my list for this type of pepper. It has a rich smokey (almost sweet) flavor with some heat. Keep in mind, no chipotle based sauce has searing heat. This blend includes some sugar and even a bit of tomato. It's only competitor, according to my taste testing, would be Tabasco's Chipotle based sauce which is also excellent. Tabasco adds primarily vinegar to its blend while, as noted, El Yucateco adds sugar and tomato paste to theirs. Both seem a bit sweet and both have a low level of heat.  Either one of these brands is vastly superior to all the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.When you can find this sauce in stores, the average price is about $2.00FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ONE but watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price per bottle combined with high shipping charges, even when you order many bottles at the same time.Watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price but then charge a very high shipping charge on A PER BOTTLE BASIS. In other words, even if you order 6 bottles at the same time - a very high shipping charge will apply - based on the single bottle shipping rate. One way a SELLER can game the Amazon system is to offer a low price but correspondingly high shipping charges on a per bottle basis. Buyer beware!BEST BUY:El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce, 5 FL OZ bottles (pack of 12) is your best buy at $30.00 with free shipping.

This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it.

Once you've used it, all other vanillas seem weak or watered down in comparison. I've been using this brand exclusively for at least 5 years now. However, I always order their Vanilla extract & didn't even realize they offered a 'paste'.I wasn't looking closely when I ordered this and was surprised when I opened this and found it was a thicker, gel-like substance. My first concern was \"will it taste as good?\" followed by \"what is being used to thicken this stuff?\". The taste seems pretty equivalent and according to the label, a tsp. of this is equal to a tsp. of their vanilla extract. The thickener used is Gum tragacanth, which if you wiki it shows as being a gum from a middle eastern tree.Personally, I'd prefer to cook with stuff that doesn't have added thickeners, colorings, artificial flavorings etc., so going forward I will be sure to check the label and order the extract. However, I didn't see anything about the gum tragacanth to make me want to toss this bottle out and not use it at all.I do not think this has better or more intense flavor than the Nielsen-Massey Vanilla extract although others here have claimed this. You do see the little bits of vanilla bean in the gel/paste, so if you like that \"look\" of vanilla bean specks in your ice cream, cake or whatever you're making then this will give you that. However, taste wise, it's not better plus you're adding a tree gum to your food.All-in-all I'll stick with the same brand vanilla extract going forward, but would be willing to order this paste again if their extract weren't available (because the taste of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla is far superior to every other vanilla I've used in the past (including home-made).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Accidentally ordered instead of the vanilla extract, it's ok but prefer their extract", "unixReviewTime": 1366675200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2013"}

Early pioneers in pregnancy testing came up with the &#34;Friedman test.&#34;,  An improvement on the 1927 test developed by Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim that used mice (You can't sell dead mice on Amazon).  The rabbit test was an advance and consisted of injecting the tested woman's urine into a female rabbit. Examining the rabbit's ovaries a few days later you would find a change in response to a hormone only secreted by pregnant women. The hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg. The rabbit test became very popular and the supply of dead rabbits increased. The term &#34;rabbit test&#34; was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language. The people who didn't know any better thought the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant. The phrase &#34;the rabbit died&#34; became as euphemism for a positive pregnancy test. Actually all rabbits used for the test died, because they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries. While it was possible to do this without killing the rabbit, it was generally deemed not worth the trouble and expense, the cheapskates!  Due to medical advances, use of a live animal is no longer required. Folks the rabbits don't have to die. Don't promote their demise by purchasing this product.A replacement for the rabbit test uses frogs, specifically the African clawed frog, which like all frogs lays eggs instead of getting pregnant, and therefore can yield a positive result on the test without the need to be cut open in order to prove it.

Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, \"Suck My Carrot\", \"Young Bunny Coed Love\", and finally, \"The Bunny Hole\".A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.Thumper was the founder and president of the \"Shake A Leg Foundation\" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder.

Chavin \"rmchavin\"", "helpful": [17, 19], "reviewText": "According to a scientific study of Japanese seaweed eaters, \"When kombu is boiled in water for 15 minutes, it can lose up to 99% of its iodine content, while iodine in sargassum, a similar brown seaweed, loses around 40% [28,29]. Processed kelp is often boiled in dye for half an hour (\"ao-kombu\" or \"kizami-kombu\") before hanging to dry [21], a process which can reduce seaweed iodine content before it is consumed. When kelp is used to flavor soup stocks, the seaweed is often removed after boiling, resulting in soup stock high in iodine.\"Many people avoid eating kombu because it contains way too much iodine.  According to the Linus Pauling Institute, people with an extremely high iodine intake will substantially increase their risk of developing thyroid papillary cancer but substantially decrease their risk of developing thyroid follicular cancer.  Thyroid papillary cancer is less aggressive and has a better prognosis than thyroid follicular cancer.However, iodine, selenium, and zinc are the 3 antioxidant minerals in human nutrition.  In my opinion, a high intake of these 3 beneficial antioxidant minerals might very likely slightly lower our risk of developing all cancers.  Thyroid cancer is extremely rare.  Even in Japan, where people eat a huge quantity of iodine from seaweed, only 1 man in 100,000 develops thyroid cancer and only 3 women in 100,000 develop thyroid cancer.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki had the highest rates of thyroid cancer in Japan, not the northeast coast of Japan where seaweed consumption is extremely high.Technically, \"brown\" seaweeds such as kombu (kelp), arame (kelp), limu moui (kelp), wakame, mozuku, and hijiki are not plants.  Biologists have placed \"brown\" seaweeds under Kingdom Chromalveolata instead of Kingdom Plantae.  However, \"red\" seaweeds such as nori (laver), ogo (limu), and dulse are classified as plants.  \"Brown\" seaweeds have rootlike structures that cling to the ocean bottom but they lack true roots, true stems, and true leaves.  Also, all \"brown\" seaweeds are rich in the extremely beneficial marine polysaccharide, fucoidan, and the extremely beneficial marine carotenoid, fucoxanthin.  By contrast, green vegetables growing on land and \"red\" seaweeds are rich in the carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin but contain zero fucoxanthin and zero fucoidan.Biologists have shown that the reason why nobody who lives within 300 miles of the ocean has ever developed an iodine deficiency is because the kelp growing near the shoreline manufacture large amounts of iodine gas which escapes to float above the surface of the ocean and gets blown inland by the wind.Attached to the surface of all \"brown\" seaweeds are probiotic saltwater bacteria which manufacture an enzyme which allows humans to digest the extremely beneficial polysaccharides and extremely beneficial carotenoids in \"brown\" seaweeds.  Without these probiotic saltwater bacteria, \"brown\" seaweeds would pass through our digestive tracts without being digested.Yes, this product is delicious but because salt always contains cancer-causing nitrosamines, it's a good idea to soak this product in water for at least 5 minutes to remove as much salt as possible.

If you want (bagged) high quality chamomile tea, stick to all-flowers, high-quality potent Traditional Medicinals brand. This produced-going by their exact instructions and a couple of variations-a browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce (darker in this case does NOT mean potent-chamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations, never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration), and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet apple-cherimoya tastes than any good chamomile.While I do tend to brew loose tea&am; picky about the actual bags used by any given brand (chemical bleaching will destroy all tea), bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea. Still, I won't be taking this anywhere-the two unused boxes will go to a food bank since I'm sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine. Frankly, Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita single-ingredient options I purchased.One thing I tend to do with every new tea  try is analyze the actual tea itself, always wet but often dry as well. This one's prominence of stems (a 1.5cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with), the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowers-very poorly handled ones!-and the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere. If you want bagged tea, Traditional Medicinals' chamomile--which is all flower, twice as flavor (and nutrient)-rich as Alvita gram for gram, and can be steeped essentially indefinitely(til the bag breaks down) without becoming bitter, which is true of nearly all pure chamomile(that isn't treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc), especially Egyptian varieties-- is so far the best I've found. Two bags of this cannot compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woody-tannins and other bitter components are from the stems, not the flower.If you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work, getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess (including how long they've been sitting around) is by far your best bet-cheapest, too, and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled double-layer mesh strainer for a few dollars-I personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden (in this case-iodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out) liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or pu'ehr steep again without too much awkwardness.The tl;dr essence of this: look elsewhere-this is extremely poor chamomile, whether you ask me, a diligent grower, or an expert-this is not advertised as twiggy tea (it'd be the wrong component anyway) and you likely aren't looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to hay-like splintery stems.

I started drinking this last time I got a caution that my liver enzymes were boderline high. I have yet to confirm that it helped, but the psychological benefits are helping a bit ;). It tastes good, and somewhat resembles hot coffee in the morning, only more healthier.On a comparitive note, the tea bags themselves are cheap. They do not have draw strings like most tea bags have, they are not individually sealed or wrapped, and they come grouped together in a non-resealing package. If this doesn't effect you that much, then I would recommend this buy because you get more tea bags for your money. Otherwise, I think you will get a better experience with Traditional Medicinals.

Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level. Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil, no more extra virgin. In Canada where the best VCOs are produced, it is illegal to even use the term, extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed. There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil, only virgin, there is no pure, no #1, no 100%, no premium liquid, or any of those terms used for coconut oils.

My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell.

Dawson", "helpful": [8, 13], "reviewText": "I'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work.  Despite pumping every three hours at work (for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day), I was starting to have to top off my baby's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash.  At first it was an extra ounce a day, then two, then three.  As any breastfeeding mother knows, that's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek, but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects, I did a ton of research on the pros/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation.  My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels, so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement.  I've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals.  This way, the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb.  It is critical to take enough, or you will not see any effect.  Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 6 pills a day).  Personally, I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 9 pills a day) to get the desired effect.  Also, you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses.  After a couple days of starting supplementation, I saw an increase in my supply, so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby's bottles during the day while I am at work.  Thanks to the fenugreek, I'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day, which is not a huge amount, but it's all I needed.

Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference. Based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply:* Fenugreek is very helpful, 2 capsules three times a day with meals, eventually working your way up to 4 capsules per meal. The body gets used to it after a while so the doctor suggested going off it for a couple of days and restarting.* Nurse 8-12x a day, putting each baby to breast until they empty it (do not time it) - the baby is much more effective than the pump at drawing the milk out than even a hospital pump, and will help increase your supply. In effect, interrupting the feeding could be counterproductive.* You can decrease the # of sessions if the amount pumped is more than 1000 ml/ 24 hrs (try pumping instead of nursing for one day to measure). You can also try weighing the baby to calculate intake, using a baby scale in grams (same as mls for calculating). Note - this will be a rough estimate as the baby may be getting more milk than the pump - and some women are unable to pump much even if they can nurse well.* Alternate sides for the babies, as one may have a stronger suck. It's possible one side will have a lot more milk than another. How you hold the baby also affects supply - if you're right handed that side will hold the baby more firmly and they may nurse longer and increase supply more on that side. All normal.* After breastfeeding the baby, pump but only for 5 minutes or so to increase demand on your body and thus milk production. Frequency is much more important than duration. Pumping for 20 min has little effect according to the doctor (I know, \"now I find out?!\" that's what I said)* If you have twins, read the bookMothering Multiples: Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More! (La Leche League International Book)by Karen Kerkhoff Gromada. I wish I had read this early on. It provides solid advice on breastfeeding multiples plus a whole lot more up to 2 yrs of age.* Try to eat well and sleep at least 6 hrs. Your milk production is directly related to your health and stress levels.* If you're able to breastfeed exclusively great but if you can't don't beat yourself up over it it's Ok to supplement (we used Enfacare as my babies were low weight, then Enfamil Premium for one and Alimentum for our other). You have a lot on your hands to worry about.* Don't try to do all feedings alone, you'll go crazy. Have your hubby do the last feeding of the night 10 or 11 pm and the early morning one (6 or 7 am) - you do the ones in between. This way, you'll each get a solid chunk of sleep. The one who's not \"on shift\" stays in the quiet bedroom without a monitor but with a cell phone. We had an extra bed in the nursery so it would be easier to nurse the babies - if I needed help (two babies crying at the same time or you're too tired) I'd call my hubby on the cell phone, but this rarely happens if you stage feedings (always feed twin A first for example). My hubby comes in at 6 am or whenever and quietly feeds the babies before they wake up so I can sleep until 8 or so.* I kept my energy and supply up withEnsure Plus - Vanillaand oatmeal.* Google \"manual expression Stanford University\", the video shows how to increase your milk supply significantly using manual expression. It works better than any other method even if it feels unusual.* If you do supplement and trying to increase breastfeeding, don't stop bottle feeding cold turkey (you may not have enough milk supply as supplementing may lower supply). Continue to supplement and give 1 oz or so BEFORE starting to nurse. The reason for this is that bottlefed babies are used to a faster flow and ready supply, with nursing it takes longer for the milk to let down. Giving the bottle-fed baby some formula before nursing will take the edge off his hunger and keep him from \"chomping away at the bit\" if you will - in other words it will calm him down and make the nursing experience more relaxing for mom & baby and allow baby to nurse longer.* Try a brief warm shower or use warm compresses (try putting warm water in a diaper) before nursing to stimulate milk let down.* Keep your eyes off the clock. Another reason to not interrupt or time breast feeding - the hind milk that lets down after the baby has been nursing a while is richer and higher in fat, more satisfying for the baby. If you stop after \"X\" minutes you may not get the hind milk.* Continue nursing 8-12x a day - don't wait too long before feedings (4+ hrs), any sign of engorgement is letting your body know there's less demand and will reduce milk production. Nursing every 2-3 hours is better, allow a stretch of 4 hours early in your sleeping cycle to feel better rested (have your hubby feed baby late at night).* Pump for a few minutes each time you nurse to simulate increased demand and boost milk production. Manual milk expression and fenugreek will also help and over time you'll need to supplement less as your milk production increases.* If you find that your supply is going down again, stop using Fenugreek for a few days, as according to doctors your body will get used to it after a while. Restart a few days later as if were from the beginning (2 capsules, 3x a day with meals, increasing to 4 x3 over time).* Don't do marathon pumping. As soon as you start feeling stressed or find yourself wondering how many ounces you've pumping, etc. you're overthinking things and this will affect your milk supply. Stop for a few minutes and go do something else. Then pump a little more. You can leave it out at room temperature while you do this - mark the time you started & date on tape w/ a Sharpie pen to be safe. If you wait 15-30 min or so, it counts as an additional pumping session (if you're trying to fit more in).* Pumping is not always a good indicator of your real milk supply (some women may not be able to pump much but nurse well) - a baby scale is the most accurate measurement if you really want to know (don't stress this too much, just nurse until baby seems full).* Feed on demand and expect cluster feeding (every 1-2 hrs) at the witching hour and just before a growth spurt.* For me at least I always had to supplement with twins because I never had enough milk for two. I did see a huge increase in my milk supply from very little to being able to nurse one baby full time for a while. Fenugreek was a HUGE help.Lastly, this tip from a sleep doctor - to handle sleep deprivation log how many hours total you slept at night (even if interrupted), find the midway point and add 12 hours. Try to take a 30-60 minute nap then, this is your natural down-time according to your inner clock and will be much better than trying to catch up on sleep on the weekends (example - slept 12am -6 am, midway point is 3 am add 12 hrs - try to nap @ 3 pm.) Keep a log of how long you sleep each time - always try to get at least 6 hrs.With Fenugreek, enough sleep, a good diet and the tips above, your milk supply should increase.*** UPDATE 12/27/12 - another reviewer has found that Fenugreek can trigger an allergic reaction in anyone allergic to peanuts, as they are in the same family.

The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).I hope some of this proves helpful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Helps to boost male libido", "unixReviewTime": 1333929600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2012"}

Now, the results were not huge and dramatic, but they are slightly and noticeably fuller and perkier after several months of taking the combo-it does take that long to notice a difference, so be faithful if you decide to try it.

Increasing estrogen can be an issue for some women with other problems( uterine, cysts, etc), so please do your research.

If they changed the type / amount of tea or spices used in the recipe, then it's not my imagination. If they did (and we will likely never know), then I'm not crazy. OK, I am, but the change in flavor is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.I used to love it; now I like it a real lot.This tea *is* yummy and usually works better for me than \"Smooth Move.\"The next part of the review may be TMI (Too Much Information) for some. You can stop reading now if you're uncomfortable talking about constipation. :-) I know many people (mostly woman) who have been dealing with this issue for years. Many things affect your digestion system: Diet, exercise, stress, medication, the amount of water you drink, etc.Here are my tips / advice. (I am not a medical doctor, nurse practitioner or even a Phd. If you are experiencing more than occasional constipation, you need to see a doctor.)Don't drink this tea all the time. It's like taking any laxative too often; it will stop being effective. Also, be sure to drink at least a glass of water after you finish the tea. More if you can.. I will sometimes drink half the tea and then let it sit overnight (covered) with the tea bag in it and finish the rest in the morning. If I'm especially \"stuffed up\" I'll use two tea bags.I use one Splenda packet to sweeten it. It's pretty sweet on its own; you may not need to add anything. Or a bit of honey is nice.The active ingredient is the herb \"senna.\" Just because it's not a prescription medication, doesn't mean it's not powerful. In fact, there are prescription laxative medications that are based on senna.The first time you use the tea, I highly recommend trying it in the morning when you can spend the day relaxing and near a bathroom. Nothing worse  than finding out in the middle of a date that this tea really works for you! (I'm lucky; my man of 16 years is so used to me and my \"issues\" I don't have to be embarrassed.)Eveyone's system is different. There are many factors that impact its effectiveness as a laxative. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work the first time or right away. It's a trial and error process. For me, drinking half of it before bed and the other half upon waking (with the tea bag(s) still in it) often works by mid-morning.I microwave a 16 or 20 ounce mug of water for 3 1/2 minutes. Then, dump the bag(s) and the sweetener, if using, in the boiled water. Cover it with a plate and let it sit until it's cool enough to drink (about 10 minutes).Even if it works, it's a good idea to clean yourself out completely every 1-3 months. Use \"Medline 1 EA/EA ENEMA BAG, W/SLIDE CLAMP, POLYBAG\"  (B0016LG9KMCheap and sanitary. I've stopped buying the red rubber kits. If you use them, fill with very hot water and a teaspoon of bleach. Slosh it around, let it sit until cool, then rinse with hot water, allowing it to run through the tubing.

My baseline product is Knox gelatin with which I am most familiar because I have been using it for years as it comes from the grocery. So far everything I have tried is MUCH better than Knox!!I decided to try this product for two reasons. First, because it is a powdered product much the same as Knox and would therefore be easy to compare. Second, because it is a bovine (beef assumedly..??) product that is differentiated from other gelatins that are pork based. I have also tried sheet gelatins (pork..) which were excellent in all respects and some gel capsules which were of no consequence at all.My main usage for gelatin is nutritional in nature as a protein enhancement to diet and as a gelling agent for aspics and a thickener for other mostly liquid preparations. Knox gelatin always worked....but I wanted something that was cleaner and clearer, smelled better and was easy to use.This product comes nicely packaged and because it is in a bulk container can be easily measured in varying quantities...something not easily done with Knox. When mixed according to directions, it forms a warm liquid that is clearer than Knox and has less odor. I am not certain about its gelling strength, mostly because I haven't directly compared it to Knox on that basis. I would need to weigh out the amounts used to properly determine that and then measure it by volume as well to eliminate possible inconsistencies with formulation and settling in packaging. I haven't taken the time to do that yet, although I probably will.So far I haven't found anything to dislike about this product.

Everything that makes me happy!I will admit here that the sheet gelatins have become my favorites for a lot of different preparations. They are so clean and so easy to use. However, for those applications where you would use a powdered gelatin, small amounts, quick thickening or easy protein supplementation in a single serving size possibly.....this product will more than meet your needs.

I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.EnjoyKen", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Tea, Good Price", "unixReviewTime": 1214870400, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2008"}

Unfortunately, while this is a good honey, it is basically a crystallized unprocessed honey with nice smoother creamed texture than typical aged granular honey. While it is marginally better than store-bought processed honey with flatter flavor and caramelized stronger aftertaste, it ultimately left me wondering \"What's the big deal?\" The Y.S. Organic raw honey is a product of Brazil & Canada, and it's worth a try if you've never tasted raw unfiltered honey before. However, I recommend that you lookout for fresh unprocessed honey from your local bee farmers instead, which may also help you ward off allergy symptoms to your local allergens. Those will taste more like the popular Honey Spoons candy (sold at Cracker Barrel) without the distinct complex flavor of aged crystallized honey which is what this honey ultimately tastes like.

USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for \"ultrapurified,\" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin.

Any time you can afford organic I believe it's worth the extra money because it's all about your health, not just taste. Everything you eat affects your health. You either pay extra now for the good stuff, or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.I get raw (unheated, never heat treated) honey from a friend now and then, she has her own hives, and Y.S. Organic honey is just as good if not better. Don't tell her, but I think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher. Who knows where her bees have been. ;)I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate, and I'm not sure what kind of honey this is (what kind of flowers) but the flavor is just right. Not too mild, not too strong, not too sweet. I know I sound like Goldie Locks, but it's just right.With honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world (scientists don't know why) I like the idea of organic hives - making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey.One word of caution though, when you shop for this honey. If you don't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic. Y.S. Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic, and they are both raw and unpasteurized. I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles (see above). Organic is in glass jars, and more expensive. Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money. But if you don't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is \"Y.S. Organic Bee Farms\", and that name is on all jars, organic or not. To make sure your honey, or any food item, is truly organic, make sure it has the certified organic seal, as this product does.~ ~ ~What you should know about raw honey vs. pasteurized honey:Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees (naturally, that's what they do) that comes straight from the bee hive (through an extracting process in a controlled setting). Raw honey is unheated, pure, unpasteurized, and unprocessed. Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase, an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads. Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it, almost like yellow wax, when at cooler room temperatures. If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.Honey is an alkaline-forming food, which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits, which become alkaline in the digestive system. It doesn't ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion. When mixed with ginger and lemon juices, it also relieves nausea and supplies energy.Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw. You can usually tell the difference by looking at it, when it's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through, like a light colored thin syrup. This is because it has been processed and pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf, and easier to handle and package because it's not as thick as raw honey.Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation. It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that's why it looks \"cleaner\" and smoother. But, when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas, yeast and enzymes (that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system) are partially destroyed. For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.CAUTION:  Bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people.

Vegemite is a tad smoother, but that's all).The consistency and colour are a bit like chocolate mousse but much thicker. It is a bit softer than Vegemite though. The predominant flavour is salty, with a noticeable aftertaste of bitter, and a hint of smoke and beer. Ignore the promotions that suggest it's a spread: it is most certainly not a spread -- if you spread it on a slice of bread like jam or butter, you'll vomit: it's too bitter in such a huge quantity. Better do this: spread some nice butter on your bread, generous amount, and then add no more than quarter teaspoon of this thing. You don't have to spread it: me, I just scoop it from the bottle and eat. Take a bite out of your bread, and then 1/4 tsp of Marmite directly off the spoon. Or you can try to spread it, but it's thicker than butter and it'll be hard to smother it evenly over butter, it'll clump and remain in one place (too much of it). A small amount does it, don't gorge, it's a strong flavour. It also works great with zesty greens, like arugula, for example. Well, there isn't much else to say: it's great stuff, and I can heartily recommend it.Don't listen too much to the talk of its being an \"acquired taste\", only for the Brits, etc. It's a normal condiment that all people will like, I believe. Which brings me to one very significant moment: it's absurdly overpriced. I would put it in the same category as, say, soy sauce, or salsa, and it should cost about the same too.Btw, don't get it here, get it locally: it's a bit more expensive but there's no shipping, so the overall cost will be much lower. I get it in Whole Foods, for the obscene seven/forty-nine a small jar (but it's less than overall here though), or, when they have it (not always), at Wegman's, for the less-unreasonable four/ninety-nine. Good stuff, but needs to be much cheaper, when will Unilever come to their senses? I think a fair price for Marmite would be like, say, three dollars for 250 grams (and it shouldn't be sold in such small jars either: 250 grams is the smallest that'd make sense, 'cause like it is, I finish it off, alone, in less than two days and have to go buy another jar). In my view, Marmite should come in 250 gram, half a kilo, and a kilo packages -- and cost a fraction of what it costs right now. It's even more expensive than Vegemite (who is available at Wegman's, for about six bucks at the time of posting). These two similar products are quite agreeable, but six to eight bucks a tiny jar is way too much, it's an insolence really. I can't give good rating to this product in view of these prices, therefore: product itself is five stars; prices one star: our overall rating here is therefore three stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Toothsome condiment, absurdly overpriced.", "unixReviewTime": 1315353600, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2011"}

To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by \"thinly?\" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi?

Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer's Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it \"very thinly, for now.\"Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast \"soldiers\" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it's made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don't like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For those who like savory flavors, a real treat on toast", "unixReviewTime": 1097539200, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2004"}

Riley", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them \"adverts\"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as \"Umami\". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6)More Than Gourmet Veggie-stock Gold; Vegetable Stock, 16-Ounce Packages", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Yankee's take on a British staple", "unixReviewTime": 1282003200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2010"}

I already drink iced tea a lot, so I wanted to see how I could use that to my advantage.  This was actually my third pu erh tea and was the better of three.  The bags were substantial and held together really well during brewing.  You might have read how many folks don't like the taste of puerh, that it tastes like dirt, well, ya, I can see that, but of the brands I've tried this one tasted a lot less like dirt. Honestly, I don't think pu erh tastes a whole lot more dirt like than cheap oolong.  Anyway.  So, for weight loss, well....  OK, the article I read says two cups with or just after each meal and a cup of green tea between meal.  I did not use this way, just can't fit that much in time wise what with brewing and all.  I made sun tea, 32 ounces of water in a glass bottle with three pu erh bags and one green chai (chai is my favorite tea of all time).  When done I'd put two packs of stevia in the raw in and I was good to go.  I'd have one cup with each meal when home.  I found that as long as I was not bad about my eating this regimen would result in a tiny bit of weight loss, a few pounds, but I just couldn't keep it going, eating out and stuff.  If I was bad with eating then drinking this tea  kept me from gaining.  I can only imagine if I really followed what the article said or if I could just keep drinking it three time every day then real weight loss could happen.  My current weight is quite troublesome as it is hormonal (perimenopause) and doesn't respond to much, even exercise.  To see what little I did see with this tea gives me hope.  I do plan to try hitting it again and try to stick with it regularly enough to affect my weight for real.  In summary, of the two pu erh teas I've tried this one was definitely better tasting and higher quality, so if you are shopping for which brand I do recommend this brand. If you are looking for a recommendation for weight loss, then I think I can say yes, pu erh can help you lose weight, but you have to drink enough of it regularly enough and paired with green tea to get it to work.  If you are looking for a healthy tea, then look no further, pu erh is higher in polyphenols than any other tea, and based on my latest cholesterol tests it really does help keep that down too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best taste of three brands I've tried, did help with weight and cholesterol too", "unixReviewTime": 1385596800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2013"}

I have been looking for something clearer and cleaner than what has typically been available in the local grocery. After reading the description of Clear Jel I was tempted to forego this one. I am glad I didn't. This product is a modified corn-starch. What does 'modified' mean?? I don't know. And truth told, I don't really care too much. The real questions that need to be answered are, \"Does it do what it is supposed to do?\", \"Does it do it better than a different, readily available product?\" and \"Is it a cost-effective alternative?\" With those questions in mind, I made the purchase and have now done some testing.1) Yes, it most certainly does exactly what it is supposed to do. It thickens 'things' beautifully and without too much difficulty in use. 2) Whether it does it 'better' or not is a very subjective thing...although there are certainly some quantifiable differences between it and regular corn-starch. After using it for several fruit based liquids, I found the end results to be remarkably clear. Far clearer than any flour or corn-starch product that I have used in the past. Another real bonus, is its ability to maintain its thickening power after repeated heatings. This makes it ideal for canning purposes where the end product must be first cooked, then canned, then used at a later date. Some thickeners won't hold up to repeated heating very well. Another point to note is this product (Clear Jel) has been used for many years in commercial applications. That doesn't necessarily make it better, but it does indicate that it has been found to be remarkable consistent and repeatable. 3) Ah, the real question is about cost-effectiveness. Clear Jel is not inexpensive (at least in these quantities..). I would be very interested in knowing what the cost differences are to a commercial account. In any event, the cost-effectiveness question can only be answered by you. I find it to be okay....not spectacular mind you....but then again I don't use it every day. But, when I need something like this to make a thickened compote or a berry pie filling or......well, anything that I want to can or preserve and still be colorful and CLEAR (or anything that I want to reheat or do a secondary cook, then it is probably worth the cost...at least to me.An interesting side note...There is an INSTANT version of Clear Jel also available.Instant Clear Jel, 1 lb.I REALLY liked it.!! If you are only going to cook or heat your product ONE TIME or, alternatively, want to thicken something COLD (NO heating!!) the instant version is probably a better bet. (Just don't try to can anything with it...manufacturer says it is NOT designed to be re-heated..)So, I give four stars for Clear Jel because it is that good. Could easily be five stars if you don't necessarily worry too much about costs. Could also be three stars if cost weighs heavily on your purchase decision.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "3 to 5 stars---depending on your reasoning..", "unixReviewTime": 1375228800, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2013"}

Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction; my face looked like a puffer fish, my heart was racing, vertigo, my tongue started to swell,  I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsed.The packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning (as it should!) about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than .5% of total volume of food or liquid.  The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris.  Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients, and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified, dried, powdered, and sold as xanthan gum. (Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food, doesn't it?)In other words, xanthan gum is an industrial processed product--  It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process--a chemical. There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA's ongoing investigations. Currently, there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it, the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed, resulting in deaths.FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive's safety. It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly.  We'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry. As a thickener, it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function. Drilling fluid serves several purposes, including cooling the drill bit, providing hydrostatic pressure, and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten, something else is added in it's place.

Shelnutt \"Mystery Novelist\"", "helpful": [29, 39], "reviewText": "Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa.The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, \"nutrition\" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of \"yummy.\").Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to \"gourmet it\" accordingly.-- As \"rice\" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with \"noodle heaven\"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).-- As \"oatmeal\" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than \"outside-the-waves\" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 () cup liquid.I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate \"lid\"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it \"steep\" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate \"lid\" I can just place it on the table for family style \"digging in.\"I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.  And now Berry Farms has been added to my list of healthful, gourmet goods.Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the \"naked\" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of \"health\"?Here's an interesting question to ponder:Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had \"lived\" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review ofVirgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.ozLinda ShelnuttAuthor of several books, including:Molasses Moon", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High Mountain Magic.

Better Than Bouillon (BTB) is one of my go-to ingredients for adding flavor to vegetable soup and stock, and also less expected dishes like pasta, or braised veggies and even stir-fry sauces.  Though shelf-stable when you buy it, the BTB needs to be refrigerated once open.  I keep mine in the door of the fridge for easy access, and can fit three or four varieties of BTB in the shelf where eggs are meant to be stored.  Though it takes up space in the fridge, it gives me lots more room in my pantry and freezer, since I'm no longer storing boxes, cans or jars of broth.I also like the flexibility to use the amount I need for a specific recipe.  I wouldn't always open a huge box of broth if I only wanted a splash of it to loosen a stew, for example, but I can easily use a 1/2 tsp of BTB in water and dilute my gravies without diluting their flavor as well.  You'd be surprised how many places you can ramp up flavor with this product.  I often use it in place of salt as well, particularly in saucy dishes where it blends easily.  The sodium content is comparable to other bouillon I've seen, but the flavor seems richer, so less is required overall.I'm not a nutritionist but I feel like I should comment on the reviews which blast BTB for adding MSG; as far as I can tell from my research, they don't add MSG.  Now, not *adding* MSG is not the same as not *having* any MSG, which is I think what confuses and frustrates some people.  MSG is a naturally occurring compound in some foods, but can also be isolated and added into foods where it doesn't naturally occur.  BTB *does* contain ingredients that have natural MSG in them, therefore it has some natural MSG as well, but is stating the truth when they say they don't use MSG as an additive.For what it's worth, completely avoiding MSG in a typical American diet can be quite a challenge.  I've gotten really horrid migraines for a long time and spent years cutting out all kinds of different foods, including MSG, to try to decrease the frequency of my headaches.  For me, MSG can make pain worse, but doesn't cause it to occur altogether.  My husband, being a thoughtful man, has made soups for me using BTB when I've been knocked out due to a migraine, and with the quantities we use in our cooking, I haven't had any problems.  Of course, your experience may differ.Overall, I highly recommend Better Than Bouillon's Vegetable Base.  It's an excellent way to add flavor to dishes, easy to use and undeniably better for you than most traditional bouillon cubes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Bouillon for Vegetable Dishes", "unixReviewTime": 1298592000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2011"}

I began to get a migraine after eating this product. I figured it said, \"USDA Organic\". Well someone is not doing the right thing cause yeast extract is on the label and it admits it is not organic, but the front is miss leading! They will not refund your money only sent you more product.  This is their email to me in regards:Good afternoon Danielle.Thank you for your email.  MSG was first produced from a seaweed broth in 1908, and today disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate can both be produced from fish or dried seaweed &#8211; although typical production of these ingredients now uses different raw materials. These flavor enhancers often work in conjunction with MSG to create a more complete flavor profile.It is important for you to know that our product does contain some MSG.  Although we do not add any MSG to our Better that Bouillon line of products, they naturally contain MSG from the ingredients we use.  MSG comes from the common amino acid glutamic acid, and glutamic acid is naturally present in our bodies, as well as in many foods and food additives.  Since glutamic acid is naturally occurring in all protein, I am not aware of a chicken broth or base that does not contain at least some natural MSG.  Of course, as you can see on our label, we do not add any additional MSG to our products.MSG has been a hot topic in the food industry for years.  Because it is a high profile ingredient, MSG has been studied extensively by the FDA as well as independent researchers.  In fact, the FDA commissioned a study on MSG in the 1995 to specifically answer the question whether MSG was safe as a food ingredient.  The study came to the conclusion that MSG was safe.  Results of this study can be found on the FDA website.[...]The term \"natural flavor,\" \"natural flavoring,\" \"flavor\" or \"flavoring\" means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product or roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portion of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.We appreciate and value your business.Kedra AndersonCustomer Service Coordinator|Customer Service DepartmentSoutheastern Mills, IncPhone 706-378-6561800-334-4468 ext 6561Fax  706-378-6578Email  kanderson@semills.comHigh Performance Work Placecid:image003.png@01CEEB65.908BAC20", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "NOT ORGANIC!!!

Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.

Here you can see the ingredients, the nutritional content PLUS the directions for making a simple sauce.The PRODUCER of the product is clear that it is a whey based powder made with shelf life and stability products, not unlike the bright yellow cheese that most kids are clamoring for on their commercial  mac n' cheese.In other words if you are trying to make a mac n' cheese with a familiar tasting cheesy sauce (yes, I'm looking at you Kraft!) but want to use your own noodles, this is a fantastic product.

Examine the description closely (and perhaps double check the manufacturer's own site for details), and check the shipping fees.

If it's a partner-vendor who stores it's inventory in an Amazon warehouse, then the same applies regarding shipping (and can be factored into costs).  If it's a partner-vendor who does not do that, well, then you must double check the shipping prices as occasionally there are some 'interesting' shipping fees to be found out there.Also, for a partner-vendor, do your due diligence regarding vendor feedback and decide if that is someone you want to do business with.I happened to have a happy experience with this product.

As a result the \"salsa\" is thinner and more watery after refrigeration overnight.  I guess for looks you can drain the salsa of the watery sauce and add more Thai sweet chili sauce again.  Use your imagination if adding new veggies and make sure that you adjust the volume of the Thai chili sauce.Mix everything in a large bowl as you add stuff and stir gently as you go.Add the magic sauce.  Put anywhere from 2 cups to the whole bottle of this Thai Chili sauce, mix well, and chill overnight.Bust it out when its cold and make sure you use Tostito scoops because the sauce will pull some liquids from the veggies so the sauce will be a little thin. You need the scoop.  Maybe the huge scoop Fritos will work too.  You'll be the hit of the party ... I hope!  Everyone I know who has tried the \"salsa\" has loved it.  A large bowl went down very fast.This sauce is great for other dishes and I've even poured it on my sandwich.  I can see this easily being salad dressing especially with won ton chips!You don't know what you're missing if you haven't tried this.  I ended up buying 4 bottles and used up the first bottle the day I opened it.I forgot to mention that these guys send the bottles quickly by UPS.

This is the original, truly. The Lee family literally invented oyster sauce. Grandpa Lee was making oyster soup and accidentally cooked it down to a thick liquid and that's how it was invented (its main ingredient is concentrated slow cooked oysters). Oyster sauce is a must-have condiment for cooking nearly every one of today's Chinese & Cantonese food dishes (that have sauce) and for a good reason. It imparts a unique flavor that can't be imitated by any other flavoring or condiment. Not sure what they used before this was invented more than 120 years ago, but we're sure glad they use it now.Be careful when purchasing, if you want this exact sauce. Lee Kum Kee makes at least 9 or 10 types of oyster sauce, but this is the best one they make, their \"premium\" oyster sauce. Still, I wonder why it's so expensive, since they have the power to buy oysters relatively cheaply by the millions and have already perfected the way it's made, getting it down to a science that for them is surely simple to do since they've been doing it for so long. Why so expensive. I imagine they charge so much because they can, since they have such a great rep for the best flavor.They make a darn good Hoisin sauce too, plus over 200 other types of sauces.The main headquarters of Lee Kum Kee is located in Hong Kong and has production bases in Xinhui, Huangpu, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Los Angeles. So those customers in America who don't like to buy imports, not to worry, chances are if you buy from a store in America you're getting the product that was made right here in California.Having said all that, it looses one star for having MSG in its ingredients. I'm also not happy that the price is so high (higher than other brands, no matter where you buy it). I always wonder, how would it taste without the MSG and caramel color. The color is naturally brown, so I don't see why coloring is needed. And salt is already a great flavor enhancer so I wonder why add MSG. I'm still searching for a great tasting oyster sauce with no MSG (and not so expensive) but haven't found one yet. When I do I'll be sure to post that info here for you all.INGREDIENTS: Oyster Extractives, Sugar, Water, Monosodium Glutamate As A Flavor Enhancer, Salt, Modified Corn Starch, Wheat Flour, Caramel Color.Learn about MSG and how many believe it is bad for your health:Excitotoxins: The Taste That KillsIn Bad Taste: The MSG Symptom ComplexThe Natural Diet: Simple Nutritional Advice For Optimal Health In The Modern World", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "BEST TASTING but CONTAINS MSG, and is expensive", "unixReviewTime": 1336608000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2012"}

And while seemingly at risk of positive review after positive review perhaps sounding 'broken record' -like, to some, my thinking is that in addition to the unique aspects found in a given review, if it helps anyone to have a particular impression and a specific 'use profile' with this salt found in more than one review, then I'm glad -- I know that it's been helpful to me, in my own experience, when reading through reviews of other products, prior to my having tried an associated item for the first time.This salt is incredible, and SO different from other salts, in terms of both its texture and its taste.  The coarseness, crunchiness, beautiful appearance, and wonderful taste of this salt lend themselves to inspired use.  And adding this salt to the 'finishing touches' of a particular item can, all by itself, render the subsequent serving of said item a 'special occasion' (that's how it feels for me).I've been spontaneously inspired to add this salt to various things (let alone things to which I would not otherwise add salt [or if I did, it would involve nowhere near the taste experience and outcome of that achieved when adding Maldon salt]), including freshly torn pieces of roast chicken (to make a heavenly treat with a delightful added taste and 'crunch factor')... and to a hardboiled egg that has been sliced in half (which, for me, 'elevates' the subsequent taste experience from something simple to something with an almost regal decadence)... as well as to the top of a simply prepared plate of 'nachos' consisting of baked blue corn tortilla chips with a minimal amount of melted mild cheddar-like cheese (and is especially good if the cheese is made from sheep's milk) -- to which the added flakes of Maldon salt atop the freshly melted cheese result in a 'sinfully delicious' taste and 'crunch' experience (with the Maldon salt's taste doing a special 'dance' with the mild saltiness of the melted cheese, and piggybacking a slamdunk terrific taste on the cheese-being-compressed-into-it bite into the chip).From the first time I tasted Maldon salt, over 10 years ago, I have considered it the best salt that I have ever tasted, and to possess my absolute favorite texture, as well -- the crunchiness of this salt, when combined with its taste, make for a heavenly combination.  And the sheer look of its beautiful flakes adds its own aesthetic enhancement to anything one 'dresses' with it.I love Maldon salt, and consider it a kind of 'special ops' wildcard of sorts, 'in the kitchen' :) -- this salt has transformative power, when it comes to food items to which it is added/topped with... and with respect to the resulting taste and crunch factor, there are striking 'before and after' 'pics' (so to speak), when it comes to the 'taste makeovers' possible in conjunction with its being the sole difference.  When sprinkling flakes of this salt atop various items, I might as well be waving a magic wand... :)Honestly, the 'reaction' I experience, when partaking of an item to which I've added Maldon Salt, is deserving of its own theme music.

This is important because we use these as a way to consume large amounts of fresh, unfiltered olive oil from Olive Leaf Hills, the only place I could find to order organic olive oil with a production date the company would admit to! We also add walnut oil, macadamia oil, and sometimes coconut oil, avocado oil and other great oils.In addition to the oils and some salt, we add powdered garlic, cumin, curry, and sometimes hot Indian red pepper powder. This produces an amazingly tasty popcorn that is packed with antioxidant punch and other health benefits!One reviewer panned this product for having bugs in it, and I also worried that after some time we might see bugs. I haven't yet, but I want to note that if you have bugs and they came from the producer on a non-organic product, at least you know it wasn't irradiated!The producer failed to respond to that customer, which is inexcusable, but that is not supposed to be covered in these reviews, but rather in the seller's review. Of course, we don't always read seller reviews, so sometimes it's not a bad thing to see such complaints here.Another thing I noticed in the 1 star reviews is that people can't understand why some of us give it 5 stars when the kernels never pop. Then I noticed lots of \"unhelpful\" ratings of the bad reviews, what is up with that? Obviously these kernels didn't work for several customers, and that is not \"unhelpful\" info!As to the question of why they didn't pop, I don't know. I used to pop these in a stainless steel pot (from Amazon) with rice bran oil (from Amazon) on a gas stove (not from Amazon). That left some unpopped, but not a large number. I have popped other kinds of popcorn, including cheap stuff purchased both in the US and in grocery stores in China when I lived there. Ordinary cheap yellow popcorn will pop more easily and reliably, but it is not as strong in terms of adding butter and oils, and lacks the antioxidant value coming from the red color.I hope that helps explain how this is both a 5 star product and a 1 star product, depending upon the reviewer's perspective. For me, it is a 5-star product.I will definitely buy these again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great snack!", "unixReviewTime": 1362700800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2013"}

Personally, I like making my popcorn on the stovetop.  I have used a method recommended by other popcorn: heat 1 tbsp oil in pot on high with 4 kernels, once the kernels pop lower heat to medium and add the rest of your kernels.  Gently shake the pot every minute or so.  Once the popping slows to 1-2 per second, turn off heat, continue to gently shake pot until all popping stops. Pour into bowl and season as desired.

Then, there's the taste, there's a layer of nuts on the outside, then chocolate, then crunchy caramel on the inside. I suppose you can melt this in your mouth but I always crunch it. It's not overly sweet which is a major plus and they say nuts and chocolate are good for your health so that's two major positives.This is a 42oz can so it's mainly for aficionados, but the great thing is, if you've never tried this before you can go to your local drug store and chances are they'll sell a small pack of these for you to try. It's great, because they only used to sell this in one size, but now they sell it in small packets to large tins like this. And tins like this are great as gifts, especially for dentists!Lastly, the tins are great and you can keep them in your pantry for putting things in.

Don't get me wrong - I am sure it's wonderful on meat, but I do not indulge in that.When I prepare this I hand coat the fish with a thin layer of olive oil, then rub in this seasoning. I let it sit overnight and - viola! - the flavors have married deeply with the fish and come out beautifully when grilled or broiled. This is definitely spicy. If you have an aversion to hot food you may want to try theWalkerswood Jamaican Mild Jerk Seasoninginstead. It has the same basic flavor profile, but without the piquant element.It's the flavor profile that not only sets this apart, but also captures the flavor of authentic Jamaican jerk. The piquant element is strictly from the Scotch bonnet peppers, which are both hot and flavorful. There is a touch of sweet from the cane sugar that is complemented by some of the aromatic spices (allspice and nutmeg.) In fact, the flavor profile is very complete because there is a touch of bitterness from the nutmeg, and sour from the citric acid. Salt is also prominent in the profile, with 540mg per two teaspoon serving. The final savory components come from the spring onion, black pepper and thyme.This is for much more than jerk barbeque though. Walkerswood provided a tip that I followed - mix a little of this into mayonnaise - that makes a perfect condiment. In fact it complements aioli (a French twist on mayonnaise).  However, I digress.

Camping trips during the fall and winter months always resulted in the evening ending with a traditional \"jawin\" session around the fire, complete of course with hot cocoa and marshmallows, among other treats.  In the beginning, real hot chocolate was used for it was easy to locate, and of course what the boys wanted and expected.  The biggest problem we had with the real thing was the obvious caffeine high it used to give the boys late at night when we least wanted it.  (As any of you with youngin's in your household can imagine, most kids don't need the bountiful effects of caffeine at any time, but especially late at night).  After the traditional session around the campfire ended, a not so well liked and substandard other tradition would unfortunately follow.  Trying to get the well wired boys to settle down and let the old men and ladies on the trip get some much needed rest.Enter carob powder.  Carob is a tropical pod that contains a sweet dark pulp that is very similar in taste and texture to cocoa.  The pulp is dried and then ground into a powder that both appears and tastes similar to chocolate.  It used to be something only available in health food stores.  But now with the advent of the internet, it is widely available here and other places online.  Despite carob powder being very similar to chocolate in calories and fats, it is nonetheless a healthier alternative.  It contains three times the calcium found in chocolate, and more importantly to me, unlike chocolate it contains no caffeine.  This was the true benefit we had in mind in substituting it for the cocoa at trails end each night.  Make no mistake about it, carob is a little sweeter, but definitely not as flavorful as real chocolate ounce for ounce.  Anyone expecting hot chocolate will be disappointed by a straight mug of carob.  It's not only not as tasty, but it remains a little grittier as well when dissolved.  Surprisingly however, my experience back in my sons scouting days proved that the boys got used to the carob powder very quickly, and actually enjoyed its little grittier texture.  As for its flavor, straight carob brewed hot reminded a lot of the scouts of Yoo Hoo drink.  Anyone familiar with the taste of Yoo Hoo can easily imagine carobs flavor.  Even if we decided to spike the carob powder with a little real chocolate, we were still giving the boys a healthier drink, and of course a lot less caffeine. We went through quite a few pounds of it in my sons younger days.  With very few complaints or disappointment.In conclusion, I highly recommend carob powder for anyone that prefers a little healthier alternative drink to real hot chocolate, and without any of the caffeine. Or, if you just happen to be one of those poor unfortunates that is allergic to chocolate. I still today buy it from Barry Farms and take it along on my own hikes here for I am so used too, and have taken a liking to its flavor over the years.  If you decide to give it a try, I recommend buying two or more pounds at a time to make the shipping a better deal.  The Barry Farms carob is a very good quality product, and has been around for many years.PS:  By the way, like some of the other reviewers here, I recommend the regular or light carob powder over the dark brewed blend also available on Amazon.

My introduction to instant eggs was not so indiscreet.  I first tasted them on a camping trip with my sons scout troop quite a few years ago.  It was late spring and getting warmer so we were concerned about bringing real eggs along.  We had the \"Honeyville\" brand that is available here on Amazon as well. I found them to be surprisingly good scrambled.  In fact when done right they seemed indiscernible to me in respect to real eggs.  Same texture and flavor.  I decided to buy more powered eggs years later when I started to do more numerous hikes that took me further out into the wilderness, and I found myself missing the taste of eggs over an open fire. Being the frugal gourmet that I am I opted to try the Barry Farm egg powder over the Honeyville for it was a bit cheaper. Not only that, but I already owned and have used Barry Farms chicken and beef bouillon powder for quite some time and found them both to be excellent in soups and stews.  I am pleased to announce that my being a tightwad this time around was very well placed, and rewarded. The Barry farm egg powder taste very good when prepared right. I make them here at home as scrambled quite often.  And as a recipe substitute I find they are undetectable as to be compared to real eggs. They are most definitely just as good as the Honeyville brand. (Although in all fairness, I have noticed lately that Barry Farm is just about the same price now as the Honeyville. I still prefer the taste of Barry Farm).  The only suggestion I would make to anyone that wishes to be adventurous and make scrambled eggs with this powder is make sure you grease the pan well.  They stick something awful if you don't, just like real eggs.  There will always be a core amount of folks that would never attempt cooking or tasting powdered eggs either scrambled or in a recipe. For those that fit into that category don't bother to get adventurous now.  For those of you that have tasted these before, or are tempted to taste them now, I highly recommend Barry Farm egg powder.

It was once available locally at health food stores and supermarkets but I've been unable to find any in the last few years.  I'm very happy to see that Amazon now has it available as an add-on at a super bargain price.  It can be bought in either a single one-pound bag or in a package of four one-pound bags.  While I bake a lot of bread, I've just been buying the single bags and they last through many loaves.  Right now Amazon charges  $7.65 for the single one-pound bags.  That is significantly cheaper than Fleishman's and Red Star bought locally for $5.00-6.00 in the 4 oz jars.  I keep the unused yeast in their original bags inside Ziploc freezer bags stored in the freezer.  For frequent daily use, I put some SAF in a Fleishman's yeast jar I kept from previous use and I keep this in the refrigerator.  This has proven to be a reliable method in keeping this yeast fresh.Other than the excellent price here on Amazon, SAF is an outstanding yeast.  It's very forgiving of the imprecise baker.  I mostly use a bread machine and I do measure the ingredients, however, I'm not dogmatic about it and I will add a little extra or a little less of some ingredients as the spirit moves me.  When using some other brands of yeast, I occasionally had minor failures.  Usually this involved the bread rising too swiftly and then cratering in the center or when using 100% whole wheat flour, sometimes the loaves were a bit on the dense side.  With only minimal attention to detail, this doesn't happen to me with SAF yeast.  Bread made with this yeast rise beautifully into consistently sturdy loaves.I do not detect any off-tastes to bread made with SAF but I never found any off-tastes to bread made with other brands of yeast either.I've read some reviews of bread machines and bread ingredients in which the reviewers say one MUST use a particular brand of flour to make a good loaf of bread.  To that I say, \"Horsefeathers!\"  Bread and all purpose flours are milled to such universal consistency around the country that it's hard to find a poor product.  If you have special needs such as a medical condition or you're concerned with only using organic products, that's a different subject and altogether outside the scope of this review.Bottom line here is that SAF is as good a bread yeast as you will find and Amazon's price is a bargain.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product, now difficult to find locally", "unixReviewTime": 1373068800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2013"}

Because of freshness? Maybe. But it does.I have also found it at restaurant supply stores and I look at that as a good thing if bakeries buy it in bulk...Negatives: None as far as quality.

This rule applies to both the SAF Instant and the Quick Rise yeast.\"\"For longer than 2 -3 months, the yeast must be stored airtight and in the freezer.  In the refrigerator, it should be airtight and should last no more than 3 months.\" (NOTE: when I asked how long it would last in the freezer I received a \"conditional\" answer. I was told that it depended on how old it already was when the package was first opened, whether it was a deep freeze or a self-defrosting freezer, and on the air-tightness of the storage container. She said to stored it in zippered plastic bags with as much air expressed out as the bag is being sealed. However, I always do that and then store the plastic bag of yeast in a tightly closed glass jar.

The area on the back of the bag for dating information looks as though the information should be added in the space below where the production date, the expiration date, and the batch number headings are listed.

While this is not a rapid yeast, the bread does seem to rise more quickly than with packets of yeast from the grocery store. This saves time and gives you an empowered feeling instead of the \"Is this going to rise or not?\" feeling.The yeast can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer and is very convenient to use. Unlike the yeast cakes, you don't have to worry about mixing it with water or milk. You just measure it into the bread machine.Here is the recipe I love making for Focaccia bread. It turns out wonderful and you can start it in the bread machine or make it by hand. We serve this in slices or squares topped with butter and fresh rosemary or an herbed cream cheese. Perfect with homemade soup in the winter.Focaccia for the Bread Machine (start in machine, finish by hand)2 1/2 cups water2 tablespoons Saf instant yeast2 tablespoons sugar2 teaspoons freshly crushed sea salt2 tablespoons olive oil6 cups all-purpose flour (the Baker's Catalogue sells an amazing flour)Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machinepan.Let it rise until double in a warm place. My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off (just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand) and this seems to create a \"just warm enough\" environment for bread to rise. Punch down and divide into thirds. Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf. This works well on the regular size cookie sheets. If you have a larger cookie sheet, you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares.Make deep indents with the end of the rolling pin handle at regular intervals. Then brush with olive oil. Let the bread rise until almost doubled.Either sprinkle with sea salt or sprinkle with dried or fresh rosemary and sea salt. You can also top the dough with tomato slices, onion slices and sliced and pitted Kalamata olives before baking.Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.After the bread cools, it will slice easily and it freezes very well. I normally slice two loaves and cut one into squares for sandwiches.To make an Herbed Cream Cheese: Blend together 1/3 cup butter, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, 2 teaspoons dried parsley, 2 teaspoons dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon dried thyme.The idea for this bread came to me after visiting a sandwich shop at a garden center in Seattle. After arriving home from visiting my grandmother, I knew I had to try to make the cream cheese and the bread because they were perfect to serve with homemade soup.This bread has a lot of possibilities so you can vary the toppings to suit the types of soups you are serving.The Instant yeast always works and with a bread machine, you end up feeling like a professional baker. The results are sure to impress. The bread always has a \"fresh from the bakery\" taste unlike the taste of breads made with packets of yeast.~The Rebecca Review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Reliable Product - Makes delicious breads...", "unixReviewTime": 1154476800, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2006"}

Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee, and even though I'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee, I can drink that with just dairy, no sugar. I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee--and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee. It was so bitter I almost couldn't drink it. It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt. And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.The problem was, I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process (the Toddy's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter, less acidic, less caffeinated coffee than normal) or the coffee brand. So, I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods (2 to a pack, very inexpensive) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy. It tasted slightly weak, oddly; however, it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee. If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees, which I don't, I think you'll enjoy it.

It will always be subjective; many people detest Starbucks coffee, but millions more like it. Some like it bold, some like it weak, some like it mild, some like it bitter, some like it sweet; no way to please everyone.This coffee is on the mild side, meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering, and is moreso on the sweeter side, meaning it's not bitter like diner-house coffee. The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee; because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor, it compliments most flavored creamers. I've had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers, and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends. The senseo medium roast so far has been the best \"starting point\", meaning nobody I've personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it. Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee, but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee. I use a single pod in approx. 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water, and it turns out great.One other thing, sometimes batches taste 'slightly' different from one-another; it's a product from a plant when all is said and done, and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste, sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another, it happens with all manufacturers (including Folgers and other large manufacturers, which I've personally tasted radical variations). I've ordered this 6-pack around 6 times so far, and only one batch was slightly odd tasting (had a much more noticeable/bitter flavor to it), other than that it has been very consistent. I left the bag slightly open on that batch, in essence making it \"go flat\" so it wasn't so bitter. While these packets are sealed, make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavor.One other thing to watch out for: increasing costs. This pack is still a great deal on Amazon, but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well. I still love this coffee, but if it goes up to $40 for a 6-pack of this, I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase.

Maybe it's because the water doesn't sit in the coffee for long enough.  Using my microwave method, I let the coffee bag brew awhile before pressing it and removing it -- very good taste.  Go figure!  Anyway, I'd recommend this coffee as microwavable bags.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "disappointed, then happy", "unixReviewTime": 1308787200, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2011"}

Crawford", "helpful": [25, 25], "reviewText": "I discovered Amber Lyn chocolate about 9 months ago and was floored by just how good this sugar free dark chocolate was.  Some people find the maltitol objectionable and its true that some folks have a harder time with its digestion, however, other sweeteners have their own issues as well, not the least of which is how it affects the taste of the product.  I'm not diabetic but I have friends who are, I am however, a life long struggler with weight and avoidance of sugar goes a long way to making that battle more productive.  But being a chocolate lover, that was always a trade off till I found this product, the taste is downright sublime and satisfies far more so than even other gourmet chocolates made with sugar.  I experimented with various brands of sugar free chocolates, but at the risk of sounding like a chocolate snob, IMO those should've come labled \"taste compromised\".  Amber Lyn's is a taste that is pure satisfaction, a single bar is so satisfying in its taste and mouth-feel that often, it will last me 3 days as I nibble on it for a desert rather than devour it (though that temptation is definitely there).  My diabetic friends have all upon exposure to its taste, promptly placed orders themselves and not one has had anything even remotely negative to say about it.Finally, a note regarding their customer service.  I live in Las Vegas where the general rule is if you're ordering food online, either avoid ordering heat sensitive goods from March to September or make sure you can get extra care in shipping.  A craving overcame my normal precaution about this and I placed a order just as temps were hitting 100 degrees and carrier trucks are often 10 degrees hotter inside.  I was fully expecting a molten mess to arrive at my door as I had spaced off my normal precautions regarding such a order, yet the package arrived in a sytrofoam lined box with cold gel packs wrapped in paper between the chocolate containers.  My order was literally in pristine condition and totally without any say so on my end, they just knew to take that extra step for their customer.  That is a very rare level of service these days and Amber Lyn cemented my loyalty for life with that move.Bottom line: If you're looking for quality, taste, and satisfaction not just for your taste buds but for your presence as a customer, I cannot recommend these people enough.

Today, the company remains with the Illy family, with the founder's grandson at the helm. They have 700 employees and sell their brand in over 100 countries. The company uses only Arabica beans, purchased directly from the farmer, rather then the middleman, and produces only one superiour blend.So much for Google info ;o)... Now, here is my personal Illy \"journey\":I am down to only one cup of coffee a day and so I need its taste to be perfect (quality vs quantity). I like my coffee very strong, but dread the bitter aftertaste many strong brands induce (Starbucks would be one). I was introduced to Illy by a co-worker a few years ago, and have not looked back... It provides the strength I crave, with a sweet and smooth aftertaste. Yes, this coffee will grow hair on your chest(figuratively...). The coffee is packed in air free conditions (with nitrogen gas), to help preserve the taste. When you pull of the inner metal seal, you will hear the air hissing its way into the can. The metal cap is a twist off. It is designed to be air tight as well, to prolong the freshness after the can has been opened.Regarding the brewing process: for a decade now I have been using the French press exclusively (I believe it delivers a stronger/sweeter brew). I find the medium grind/medium roast \"blue band\" Illy to be perfect for the purpose. The instructions on the back of the can help you with coffee to water ratio for both the drip machine and the French press. Do not over-agitate the French press after brewing and you will be ok. Alternately, you may purchase whole Illy beans and grind them to your satisfaction (sadly, I am too lazy for that...).Regarding Amazon price and service: Illy is not easy to find in certain parts of the country. Where I live, it requires a trip to the local mall... So, I was happy to find that Amazon offered this product at the same price as my mall, with the cost free, directly to my door, service.

When all of the water in the mix is gone, you have a dish any Chinese restaurant in New York will charge plenty for.3-It's also good on ribs but you have to experiment to get the exact results you want.4-After tidbits and ribs, the best use is on chicken; again, you have to experiment with the blend of oven, grill to get the exact balance of baking, char, and Noh's.Overall, a great little secret that brings the restaurant into your home.

First, it is always fresh, where I've noticed that grocery store (USA) brand are often stale. Besides the flavor, what really sold me on PGT is the strength of the tea. For example, in my ice tea maker, two teaspoons of PGT makes a perfect pot of tea, and I like my ice tea strong enough to stand up against the ice cubes. (I learned from my grandmother that the best ices tea is hot tea poured over the ice.) Living in the South, I drink my tea iced 12 months a year, but PGT was made for tea time and is perfect brewed in my grandmother's vintage tea pot, as well. Add milk and sugar and some &#34;biscuits,&#34; and I feel as if I were living on &#34;the other side of the pond.&#34;PG Tips tea (loose or t-bags) is one of the little luxuries in life and Amazon makes it possible for me to enjoy quality and taste. I find that when you factor in the tiny amount of PGT it takes to make my tea (as opposed to having to use three or four times the amounts of grocery store brands) PGT is actually less expensive than Lipton. Amazon's vendor makes it easy to keep PGT in my cupboard. It is always shipped to me within a few days of placing my order.

Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.PG Tips also sells loose tea. Many tea enthusiasts prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive \"fannings\" or \"dust,\" remains from processing loose leaf tea.

I purchased both this liquid sweetener and another that has a mild strawberry flavor. To be honest, I haven't tried the plain liquid yet but I have tried the strawberry one (which I am assuming is probably the same thing with added flavor).Since I have read over and over people complaining of getting a bitter or weird after taste from stevia products, I decided to add one drop at a time to a 12oz glass of water; tasting as I went. I stopped at 15 drops... was a nice subtle strawberry flavor/scent/sweetness with little to no after-taste.Stevia does have an inherant \"bitterness\" to it but this bitterness varies from product to product and can mostly be controlled by the amount used (although some brands have more of the bitterness than others). If you add too much you will get the strong bitter/weird after-taste.If you like a subtle sweetness you will probably like most Stevita products but if you are looking for a sweetener to make things super sweet as in Kool-Aid, grape juice, pop, etc... this probably isn't the sweetnener for you as the bitter taste will be quite pronounced at that level of sweetness.I bought the flavored sweetener to put in my purse... so when I go out to eat or grab a bottle of water on-the-go I can quickly and easily add a few drops to the water and have something with flavor instead of plain water all the time (I am on a low carb diet but plan to maintain a lower carb lifestyle even after I have lost the excess weight).When I try the plain liquid sweetener, if I have a different opinion, I will update this review =)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My review is for the flavored liquid sweetener...", "unixReviewTime": 1191974400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2007"}

I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.

Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.

The box contains a dizzying array of candy that was popular in the 1960s. Many of these candies have been rarely to never seen in the years since. Some can't pass contemporary political muster (candy cigarettes or licorice pipes, anyone?) and some were novelties even at the time (wax lips, for instance) and don't taste any better now than they did then. Sadly many of the candies are now made overseas (the candy cigarettes were made, much to my surprise, in Macedonia), but they do look and taste authentic and are packaged nicely in a sturdy box with a bow on it.One of my favorites in the box is the \"Big Hunk\" candy bar which I remember dimly at best. Although the directions for preparing and eating the \"Big Hunk\" on the back are certainly modern (and involve either flinging your \"Big Hunk\" as hard as you can or microwaving it), they are very funny nonetheless. I really love the \"Lemon Heads\" and \"Cherry Heads\" and I don't think I had seen cinnamon toothpicks for decades, but the real treat in the box for me was the little bag of \"Gold Mine Gum\" which is still as cool (and tasty) as it was years ago.This is an expensive box of candy, and is probably not something you would buy every day.

That review is below.  I have never ordered seeds from Todd's.  Seed quality varies greatly for many reasons including the storage and shipping conditions and the age of the seed. I don't know whose fault it is that my review of Sprout House Seeds which are excellent ended up under Todd's seeds.  Todd has said that he has requested that this issue be corrected but that Amazon has refused.I am leaving this review here to alert you to the fact that all reviews posted under Todd's seeds relating to a product reviewed before early 2010 cannot be referring to Todd's company.  Todd did not start selling organic broccoli seeds on Amazon until early 2010.  In addition, any reviews referencing a product bought from Sprout House would not be applicable to Todd's Seeds.INITIAL REVIEW:I am very happy with these seeds.  High yield, in my opinion relatively mild flavor for broccoli sprouts and Rita the Sprout Lady at Sprout House provides cheerful, great, fast service. If you eat broccoli sprouts or want to, sprouting your own is the way to go.  Much less expensive than buying the sprouts at the grocery store and the quality of your own sprouts will be superior - much fresher and crisper.UPDATE: April 27,2011.  I had some leftover broccoli seeds that I kept in the refrigerator for two years from Sprout House.  They are still sprouting well and are delicious.  They just take a little longer to get going than when they were first purchased.FOLLOW UP REVIEW WHEN MY SPROUT HOUSE REVIEW STARTED APPEARING UNDER TODD'S SEEDS:UPDATE: August 11, 2011.

The seed is very fresh.  I had near 100% germination, and this blend; brocoli, radish clover, is really nice.  The radish gives it a little bit of tang, the broccoli a bit more body.  The fresh sprouts are so much better than what you get in the market!  We have been eating them out of the jar.  (I have mine sprouting in a jar, with a sprouting lid :Sprouting Strainer Lid  This is an economical way to try sprouting, if you don't already have a sprouter.  For those who do, I will just recommend this blend.  The flavors, size, germination time compliment each other & work nicely together.  It is also a very good value.  Broccoli seed & sprouts are generally more expensive.  I like that this seller is honest and not representing this as broccli sprout (disguising the blend) or overcharging for it.  For those who generally buy sprouts and are considering growing them: I started with the recommended 2 tablespoons.  This filled a quart jar in a few days, producing about what you get in a 4 oz bag at the supermarket.  Here (in Hawaii) that bag costs around $3.  I do not know exactly how many tablespoons you get from a pound of seed, but judging by what I have used, I am guessing at least 40.  That means that buying this many sprouts at the market would have cost me at least $60, and would not have been as fresh, nutricious, crisp or flavorful.So far none of ours has made it to the fridge, and I am going to try to keep it that way. (they start losing sugars, nutrician and flavor as soon as you refrigerate).  Given that this is the first batch we may well get through them without putting them away.  I think for the next batch i will just sprout 1 tablespoon, and if I want mo9re, start another batch a couple of days later.  I really want to have them fresh and not out of the refrigerator (that is why I am sprouting to begin with).It is very humdid here, so to keep them fresh I am going to pack in a jar with some silica gel packs.  keeping the seed in the refigerator might not be a bad idea (though it is humid in there too and may reduce germinhation).  the freezer; not such a good idea.  i suspect that would severely reduce germination, if not kill the seed (depending on the temp of your freezer).  Seed keeps well if it is dry & out of direct light.the instructions provided are good enough to get a novice going in no time (and honestly, you can grow them with just a jar, cheesecloth and a rubber band).  sprouting is really easy, and the sprout house makes it all the more so.  I wrote this review when I came back to see who I had gotten the seed from, as I want to see what else they have; a happy customer coming back for more.I am appending my review to note that I bought my seed from the sprout house, fulfilled by Amazon and can not attest to either the price or quality of seed sold by other marketplace seelers.

Manufactured in Sweden, these are appreciated around the world. Why do I appreciate them so much? What are they like? Well, here goes:Sugar free with only 3 calories per serving, they are sweetened with xylitol, which occurs naturally in the fiber of many fruits and vegetables. Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and doesn't impact blood sugar, so diabetics can enjoy them. With these, I haven't noticed any tummy discomfort as I do with Sorbitol or Aspartame. I don't really consider these as candy in the normal sense, but more as a refreshment. These pastilles are a wonderful treat that can help prevent cavities by keeping the saliva flowing. This is especially helpful for those of us who are stressed, have a medical condition or take medications that can cause dry mouth. These pastilles are firm but chewy, and also melt in one's mouth. There are no sharp edges which can occur with some hard candies.The taste is distinctive, rich and pleasurable, with notes of licorice and menthol.  A serving is two pieces, with a total of 12 servings per box (which is small enough to discreetly carry in a pocket or purse.)Lakerol Special Licorice pastilles come in handy, too.  Ever need to change the subject in a hurry? Offer one of these. Got the munchies at 2:00 a.m. but want to wake up free of guilt? Forget the cake and have a couple of these instead! Mouth going dry on your way to the principal's office? (Or enrolled in a speech class?) No problem. These will help!  Bored stiff trying to do your taxes? Lakerol and a stroll away from your desk will help refresh you... and with luck you will think of a couple more deductions.If you suffer from arthritis or any other source of chronic pain as I do (ankylosing spondylitis), these may help distract you from the pain and help you proactively focus on doing something kind and positive for yourself, such as gentle stretching or a hot bath.These do have menthol, but are not overwhelmingly strong, which is a nice plus. If you have a sensitive mouth, as I do, this can be very comforting. Also, I'm a chocoholic, but more often than not these stop those cravings and reframe my feelings to something more positive.My husband and I both love these and wouldn't want to be without them. Whoever invented them must be a genius! I've ordered them multiple times through Amazon.com and am extremely satisfied.  My order often arrives within four days or so. What more could I ask for?

I've been enjoying numerous scents of Jason Lotions for several decades. Being a major lover of Lavender, I've always been on the lookout for good Lavender lotions over the years, and there are few that have come close to this one, so I've kept coming back to it.Some say that Jason has changed the formula of some of their lotions lately, such as this one and the Rosewater. I don't know about that yet. So far, so good, in my experience to date. I truly hope Jason does continue to keep their scents true and the ingredients pure and natural. I have enjoyed many Jason lotion `flavors', such as the Lavender, Rosewater, Apricot, Cocoa Butter and Chamomile, and they have all been `delicious' and kind to my family's skin.Lavender calms, they say. That fragrance apparently helps you relax at night for slumbers, or other times. Thus, a Lavender lotion should be a good thing to put on before retiring or just to slow the pace and breathe deeply.

The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.

These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.If being \"in love\" gives you a zest for life, then the \"I Love You\" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box):Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganacheLingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.Also Recommended:If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium.

The reason? Japanese mayo is different. And it tastes better.Before that, I was only familiar with standard American supermarket varieties like Hellman's and Kraft, and the idea of putting them on things like leaf salads and fries wasn't particularly appealing.Kewpie, though the ingredients are similar, has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture, making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods. They go great on fries (Belgian style), leaf salads, and grilled meats. Japanese people put mayo on a lot of things, including okonomiyaki, takoyaki, yakitori, even pizza.There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle. It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob. The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag, with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti. This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food, letting you control its distribution as well as design. Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns, like the pattern you see on the bag. If you remove the cap, the inner opening is star shaped, allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.It is far superior toKraft Mayo Real Mayonnaise, 18-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles, which come in an overly-rigid bottle with a horizontal slot that easily introduces air into the bottle as it re-inflates for the next squeeze, causing frequent splatter. Mayo also clings to the bottle's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze. Kewpie doesn't have this problem. It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube. Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy. The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels, making it easy to see how much is left, and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.Nutrition values are similar to American mayo. 100 calories per tablespoon (90 from fat), 20mg cholesterol, 100mg sodium. It does not contain any preservatives or artificial additives besides MSG. Kewpie is made in Japan, not in US subsidiary factories, so this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite.

You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must-have for dynamite sauce", "unixReviewTime": 1189728000, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2007"}

McGee \"KayJay\"", "helpful": [24, 28], "reviewText": "I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.What to do??I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes \"okay\" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency.

Allen Greenbaum", "helpful": [94, 105], "reviewText": "In this multi-level analysis of Newman-O's vs. Oreos, we consider three areas:  Taste, Values, and Nutrition (as always, consult a physician or other professional about nutritional concerns).1) Taste. A Draw--Newman-O's for adults/Oreos for kids:Nutritional considerations aside, Kraft (which owns Nabisco) Oreos have the advantage of more sugar and a familiarity that does not bring contempt.  Newman's have a more \"mature\" taste, heavier on the cocoa side with hints of dark chocolate, and not as sweet as Oreos.  Newman-O's, however, are somewhat of an acquire d taste:  At first I didn't like them, then began to appreciate the more subtle cocoa flavors.  My hunch, though, is that kids will prefer Oreos.2) Values. Newman 1, Kraft 0 (maybe even -1):Threatened by a lawsuit and federal truth-in-labeling regulations, Kraft finally removed the trans fat (probably the worst kind of fat) from Oreos in 2006, even though a company spokesperson once said this would be \"difficult,\"  and that trans fat availability should be left to nutritionists, not to legislators or the courts. (Perhaps Oreos are \"red state\" cookies, and Newman's are for \"blue staters?\") Before legislation requiring labeling of any trans fat of half a gram or more, Kraft did not list it; Newman)'s never had it.Newman's, as always, donates all after-tax profits to charity; Kraft donates an unknown amount, because they don't publicize it, and because you can bet the CEO's stock options that they're not donating all of it. While I don't want to get too political here, Newman's uses a number of organic ingredients, and organic food proponents cite the resulting health and environmental benefits.3) Nutrition. Advantage, Newman-O's, but 2 cookies or 3?It turns out that nutritional information for Oreos is based on a 34 gram,  three cookie serving size; Newman-O's uses a 28 gram, 2 cookie serving size.  As shown below, the 2 cookie serving size outclasses Oreos on having more of the good and less of the bad. One could argue, however, that this is an unfair comparison, because a serving size of Newman-0's is  % smaller than that for Oreos. (Although one could also argue that Newman's supports \"portion control.\" However, if your portion control isn't controlled and you have 3 Newman-O's, the nutritional edge decreases. Still, even 3 Newman's (compared to 3 Oreos) gives you 3.57% less total fat, and less sodium. However, you'll consume 11% more saturated fat, more carbohydrates (47.25 grams to 25 for 3 Oreos), more calories (195 to 160).  Some people may also prefer Newman-O's wheat-free ingredients and use of sweeteners, rather than the often maligned high-fructose corn syrup found in Kraft Oreos.The Verdict. A great Paul Newman movie!  Oh, and if I have to choose, I'd say at least try the Newman-O's. You (the adult, but perhaps not your kids) may like the taste better than Oreos, and the 2 cookie serving size handily beats the 3 serving-size of Oreos on total and saturated fat, sugar, calories, and sodium (as well as containng more organic ingredients).  At three cookies each, the difference begin to disappear, though with Newman-O's you satisfy not your appetite for cookies, but your hunger for helping people in need.

So in this case three cups water to the one cup millet and one cup amaranth.  Cook at 15psi for ten minutes.  When cooking done and pressure naturally released, mash up potatoes with fork and stir everything together with a measure of olive oil and bit salt or your favorite spices, garlic, diced veggies etc.  Serve hot.

I always look for healthy foods and consume many unconventional food items that offer nutrients and micro-nutrients. Organic sesame seed was becoming hard to find. On my search for calcium, I came across amaranth. It was a flop with me at first but with many nutrients, price, gluten free, grown in US organically, available all the time, I tried till I got it the way I wanted to get the taste and the nutrients which has been a great addition to my diet.Quinoa is the beef for vegans and nothing matches the complete protein of quinoa, and I mean nothing. Amaranth is half the cost of quinoa but only in comparison to yellow one. Red quinoa is almost three times more than amaranth. Amaranth has high amounts of minerals, such as calcium, iron, magnesium and phosphorus where quinoa contains more vitamin E but does not match the overall vitamin and mineral profile of amaranth. In one cup of cooked, calories 251 vs. 222, protein 19% vs. 16%, calcium 12 vs. 3 (unbelievable since sesame seed has fat and Amaranth zero for the calcium), iron 29% vs. 15% (unbelievable again)... Lima beans offers accordingly 229, 29% (not a complete protein), 5% and 24% but none comes close to fiber of lima, a whopping 56%...  Quinoa is a milder taste grain cooks in ten minutes, no more no less, ready for me on the spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but amaranth takes longer, and I mean really, really longer so it is completely a different process. Amaranth is like okra, slimy, darker color and harder to prepare so I have no idea how some of those reviewers claim they prepare and have it for breakfast since it will not be ready for breakfast. I never soak quinoa but with amaranth, I treat it just like a bean.I consume amaranth buy preparing differently depending to how much time I like to spend;1. As raw food for the highest amount nutrients which means no applied heat, I ground it with flax and sesame seed in coffee grinder for my power drinks. Nine tbsp which is some 100gr of these beauties offer me 16% calcium and 62% magnesium with that needed 24mg of Phytosterols for lowering cholesterol.2. I roast with RPO for less saturated fat and more EFAs, and sometimes with EVCO but never with my favorite EVOO since it does not complement the taste. I use the same process as I pop popcorn.3. For meals, I soak in advance in a 16qt sauce pan for a day. I drain the water and rinse. Cook for thirty minutes which gets it slimy enough then add all other food ingredients to the mix. That process requires more water and oil. I cook the mix just like I would with okra with the difference that fresh okra is hard to find.Sesame seed is a priority to me but it lacks protein where quinoa makes up for it. Amaranth vs. sesame is 88%-%62%=%24 less magnesium in 100 gram and less of many other nutrients than sesame but the catch is 573-371=202 less calories, 35%-7%=28% less saturated fat than sesame at half the cost of yellow and third cost of black sesame.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hello Quinoa...", "unixReviewTime": 1370304000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2013"}

Arrowhead is an excellent brand with many great organic products where others fail to produce in organic form but this approach is just misleading and not necessary at all.*****************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/11/2013Seller claims;List Price: $40.61Price: $8.24 ($0.04/oz) & FREE Shipping on orders over $25You Save: $32.37 (80%)That is misleading. No flax sells for $40 a pound. At $8.24 a pound it is 824/16=51.5 infact something like more than $0.51 cents an oz not $0.04 an oz. Arrowhead is a good brand but the seller is misrepresenting the facts.*****************************************************************************************************************************MISLEADING LABELING: sprinkle a tablespoon of ground seeds... 14oz not 16 oz since it is golden not brown.It is shame that Arrowhead with so many fine organic products will misguide consumers just to sell a product. In the beginning there was only one color flax which was brown but now there is golden as well. Usually in organic form except in supplement form, the farmer co-up flax or any type of seeds are always more expensive due to their practices which is not sold on Amazon at all. Brown and golden have the same nutritional value so I never consume one, I mix brown and golden regardless. In some cases Golden is more expensive than brown. If not specified on the labeling the type of flax, then it means brown flax not golden flax.OILS: I started consuming flax oil years ago per my physician's advise not knowing that majority forms of flaxseeds are rancid and absolutely worthless due to oil in seeds. As whole, human body cannot digest any seed that size with that consistency regardless if it is flax, sesame, amaranth, chia, millet, etc. unless cooked or in ground form since human body cannot digest in its natural form. As SUPPLEMENT, TABLET FORM, OIL, POWDER, GROUND IN BAGS are all worthless and hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. Rancid is a process of Mother Nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed. Advising consumers to purchase different brands of flax in oil form or powder or tablet form are all marketing tools as well. It is not important even if the oil or the tablet or the powder in bags are even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the type or brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed and air will get to the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if you keep the rice in a sealed container, wrapped in the most elaborate sealing containers in the world regardless. Chia is the only seed that claims it does not need to be ground but that is a marketing tool just like the price of chia is since it comes from outside US and individuals without any knowledge about nutrition always associate those as superior for exotic reasons and pay a hefty price for a food item with less nutrients. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed. After many years of consuming seeds, I chose to ground all seeds myself and seal immediately, kept in freezer and consumed within few days which I am very happy with the results since after all looking fit and well is just result of training hard and living a healthy lifestyle which surrounds any professional athlete or a happy individual involved in many sport activities regardless.OMEGA 3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA and it is the same for any brand of flax seed regardless if such flax seed oil is in solid oil form in a bottle or a capsule form. Greens, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3 since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseeds are important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is the king of nutrients when it comes to minerals so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, highest magnesium, highest potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional.FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16&#8201;lb with 3.7\" (9.5&#8201;cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1\"(2.5&#8201;cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia. Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts, a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat, chicken, pork or dairy.Accordingly for 28gr/1oz servings size of;Amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachioTOTAL CALORIES28.6__33.6__ 150__166__161__137__160__162__155__156CALORIES FROM CARBS21.2__23.6__33__28.9__24.6__50__26.8__31.2__34.4__31.8CALORIES FROM FAT3.7__4.8__98.8__121__116__72.1__116__112__103__104CALORIES FROM PROTEIN3.7__4.9__17.8__16.8__20.6__15.2__17.2__19.1__17.7__20For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia's \"CARB CALORIES\" gain but 50% more \"FAT CALORIES\" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss.

No wonder Burma is the highest producer of sesame in the world. But none of those kings offer ALA and not only flax's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so worthless and abandoned in all foods that not healthy at all.

This plant has very similar growth and flowers to the Rooibos plant. The specific name linearis comes from the plant's linear growing structure and needle-like leaves.The leaves are used to make an herbal tea called Rooibos, bush tea (esp. Southern Africa), or simply rooibos. The product has been popular in Southern Africa for generations and is now consumed in many countries.

My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie.

These are a good, basic product made up of \"caps\" (there are in fact stem pieces in most of the caps, but limited to about 1/2 inch maximum). They average about 2-3 inches in diameter, and are well-dried and packed in plastic bags (not re-sealable.. but doesn't matter for mushrooms)Dried mushrooms are not (and never will be) \"like fresh\" anymore than say, dried basil, will become \"fresh\" basil. But they are an ingredient in their own right. They provide spectacular flavor (and these are excellent). It is worth noting that, because most people who cook by soaking dried mushroom chop them before adding to the end-product. This is because their texture is rather \"rubbery\" as noted by another reviewer. For that reason these are \"overkill\". If you can find shiitake bits and pieces at better prices, by all means use that instead. Personally I find this meaty chewiness to be pleasant, but some may be put off by it.. you could even put them through a processor after soaking and recovering the liquid.. I certainly wouldn't toss them!I think at $11-12 per pound they are reasonably priced, but not bargains.. still much cheaper than fresh. A pound dried is probably 20 pounds fresh or better.Shipping is an added hit. I try to group purchases of several items in order to \"even out\" the shipping costs. JR Mushrooms has quite an array of products if you go to their Amazon page. I have had excellent luck with J R Mushrooms in the past and they are a \"go-to\" for me often.My co-op has dried mushrooms (more expensive and not as high a quality.. but they are expensive anyways) If you have a sizable Asian community, you may be able to find them at better prices locally.I didn't discover dried mushrooms in my food experience until recently.. I have integrated them into my cuisine ... a staple part. I find now that in other countries, dried are everyday items in their cooking. Mushrooms are something I didn't like (and had little exposure to) as a child, but in later life I've discovered their wonders! Fresh mushrooms are fine, but are not cheap and keep very poorly.. what to do? DRIED!  I rarely make a stock-based dish that I don't add dried mushrooms to in some form. I also use fresh for salads and the like, but dried ROCKS.Aside: On \"The Mind of a Chef\" (PBS) identical dried shiitakes are used in a highly-rated Japanese noodle broth, THEN they take the caps out and pickle them in a soy sauce as a separate product.. typical \"country boy\" resourceful!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "These are staples, not curiosities :D", "unixReviewTime": 1359849600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2013"}

I was happy to see that they had healthier fare to choose from, and sushi, so I filled my plate with steamed veggies, sushi and a dumpling or two. I sat down alone at my table, facing away from everyone because I just have this thing about people watching me eat, and something really brightly red caught my eye. It was in a Giant squeezy bottle, with a rooster on the front; I picked it up and read the label \"Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce\". Hmmm, a condiment that I haven't heard of, ME the so called Condiment Queen of Gainesville Florida. I squirted a bit on my plate, dipped my chopsticks in it and tasted it, GOOD LORD UP ABOVE, it was Huy Fong good, spicy garlicky vinegary so tasty, I then doused my entire meal with the HazMat red concoction and reveled in its goodness. I rushed out after work to the nearest Asian market, of which I frequent a lot, and there it was so many squeezy bottles how did I ever miss them before? I grabbed three, plus two of my regular Hoi sin bottles, a jar of pickled ginger and proceeded to grin like a Cheshire cat to the register. On the bottle it also says its good on pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, pasta and I have to admit the stuff is good on almost everything.

Some hot sauces are more of a watery, hot-vinegar taste.  Others have SO much heat to them that flavor can't actually be determined...all you can tell is that your mouth is on fire.

The first ingredient of many hot sauces is vinegar, or in some cases, even just water.  The red jalapenos in this sriracha sauce are definitely hot, but with a bit of a fruity taste that is sweetened with the small amount of sugar it contains.It's great as just a condiment on whatever food you like hot sauce on (which, in our family, is most foods).  It's also a wonderful addition to many recipes.  In a stir-fry, I'll use this sriracha as part of my heat base in the sauce.  A small amount added to a cream sauce or mayonnaise dressing adds a lot of zing.This Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce is generally found in the Top Ten in most published rankings of the best hot sauces...and many times it is in first place.

Like Tabasco - it is primarily a hot (cayenne?) pepper delivery device. A few drops add a considerable amount of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a heavy dose of vinegar - this sauce has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle amount of sweetness to this sauce along with faint garlic notes. While Tabasco can taste quite harsh if you add too much to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet but of course can become far too hot if you add too much.I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato was simply the \"sun ripened chilies\" and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary tasteWhile I really like this product and certainly recommend its purchase --------- I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem TRULY exceptional - only VERY GOOD.  There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic certainly beats (by a very wide margin) --- the heavy vinegar aftertaste as evidenced in Tabasco and many other hot sauces.For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to always have it on hand and it is a true staple.Amazon prices the 17oz at $5.19 and the 27oz at $5.89. It is a true no-brainer to purchase the 28oz size.As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably ONLY want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.Update (July 2010) - a formal taste testI put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too \"hot\" to tasteResults: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh and sweeter noteUpdate (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.Another Update: Bon Appetit magazine recently rated this sauce as \"ingredient of the year\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Potent Hot Sauce, similar to Tabasco, just far, far Better.

But if you're here and looking at reviews I'm guessing that you haven't had an opportunity to try it out yet.

It is excellent for spicing up a dish in the kitchen. I use it in several different recipes to add a nice kick. In fact, my understanding is that Sriracha got its fame as restaurants discovered the product and starting using it in their recipes. It also works great as a condiment, and is slowly showing up on restaurant tables as the years go by.  I've come to the point where I'll even dip my pizza in this stuff, it's that good! It might take you a few tries to learn what the right amount of sauce is for you to get that lip tingling boost to your favorite foods, but find it you will, and you won't regret the purchase. The bottom line is that your kitchen probably shouldn't be considered complete without a bottle of Sriracha present.

As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco, yet blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering. As I've learned, if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample, but don't live in fear of hot sauces.  Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it's a known quality and consistent, unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants (believe me...I've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT).  And certainly don't be intimidated by the \"screaming chicken\"; it might well become your new friend!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not as hot as I feared and quite tasty!", "unixReviewTime": 1345334400, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2012"}

I bake a lot, so it's gone into cookies, cakes, frosting, muffins, quickbreads, and more.  Sometimes I put just a bit in homemade yogurt (after fermenting, as I don't want any of the culture bacteria to get killed by the alcohol).  I've used it in pancakes and granola, as well.  It provides a really nice flavor without being overpowering.  The strength of the vanilla flavor is appropriate (that is, you can use the amount your recipe specifies -- no need to double up or anything).If you are the type of shopper who is concerned about the environment, you should know that Simply Organic donates a percentage of sales to promoting organic agriculture -- this means fewer pesticides and less fertilizer runoff getting into the environment.  Further, note that the bottle is glass instead of plastic (the lid is metal with a lining), so you don't have to worry about chemicals leaching from plastic and getting into your food.

It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi brand but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi brand, and most other Japanese brands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi brand just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag.

Not just because they are sold in bulk,  but because we found every package better than those from the stores.

Think about it - they aren't transported by truck for who-knows-how-long; they don't sit in a store cooler for who-knows-how-long before being stocked in the store;  and so they don't dry out.  The plastic packaging is pretty thin, so over time, they will dry out.  Worth the shipping cost.  This time of year and up here in far north Michigan, I store the box in the garage, but would gladly store in my freezer in warm weather, (extra protection by packing in 2-gal zip bags.)

Hon Dashi is made from katsuobushi shavings, so it is a basic fish stock and not suitable for vegans, who would probably want to make their own kombu stock.I use Hon Dashi for almost everything, from basic miso soup, totamagoyaki, to using it to boil vegetables and give them a heartier flavor.

Yes, horseradish is much inferior to real wasabi in taste qualities, but I think that is missing the point. Very few people outside of Japan know what real wasabi tastes or even looks like, so the point is moot. If you are looking at any kind of prepared \"wasabi\" product, chances are almost 100% that it will be Western horseradish (seiyo wasabi) and not Japanese wasabi. Don't expect to find 100% pure wasabi in a tube.Japanese routinely eat sushi with \"fake\" wasabi, so there is no stigma against it. Real wasabi is too prized and scarce to grind up in large batches and let sit around. Once grated, real wasabi loses its pungency very quickly in the presence of oxygen (within 15-20 minutes). When presented to diners, wasabi is offered as a small root placed on top of a grater so you can grind the paste yourself.Few Japanese people expect real wasabi except at fine sushi restaurants. Everywhere else, it's this horseradish stuff dyed an unnatural shade of green, either offered as a tube or a ball of \"wasabi clay\" made from powdered horseradish. Real wasabi is notoriously finicky about its growing conditions and difficult to cultivate. What quantities not quickly snapped up by restaurants are sold to end consumers fresh as thumb shaped roots. Availability was sporadic and unpredictable in my supermarkets when I lived in Japan, and most people are happy with buying prepared wasabi substitutes like this for everyday use. S&B; tube wasabi is commonly found in Japanese grocery stores and homes. It is also included as little squeeze packets in supermarket sushi sets.If you ever have the chance to try real wasabi, do it! The taste is so different and hard to describe.. it has a sort of sweetness and pleasant pungency that horseradish cannot reproduce. Horseradish just gives you that powerful nasal burn. Real wasabi doesn't.That having been said, S&B; is an excellent sushi condiment when real wasabi isn't practical or available. I have used it for many years and will continue to use it.

When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. When people bite into it... well who knows! Two recent studies linked the pesticide toxins in the corn to human cell membrane death and the death of neonatal kidney cells. A study done in Canada found the Bt toxins in the blood serum of 93% of pregnant women tested, and 80% of their unborn babies.

For a while I had a rebellion against this soda because of them making changes in their taste to match other companies. I guess thats a marketing technique or something, because the goal is to sell more products, and have a higher turnover rate. And for about 3 years, I wouldn't drink this soda. Just about the start of this year I decided to give Coca Cola Classic another try, and thinking they are going back to the older formula (trust me, you can notice the difference). Coca Cola is on the rise once again, and I hope that it will be back on top with their products in the soda industry.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"", "helpful": [10, 18], "reviewText": "There are two soft drink giants in North America, and I assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the Coca Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company.  The battle between these two giants has many fields, including fountain drinks, schools, and grocery stores.  At various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market, with Coke currently being ascendant.We drank Coke in our house from the time I can remember.  There were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which I have been exposed, but I have always returned to the original, Coca Cola.Coca Cola is more than a soft drink; it is frequently synonymous with America and freedom in many parts of the world.  In fact, you can say that Coca Cola has become an American icon, though it is available world wide.  Coca Cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles, with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money.At the core of the company name, the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself, the one and only Coca Cola.  The product itself started life as a tonic in 1886, growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the American brand with the greatest world-wide recognition.I think I prefer Coke over Pepsi because Coke has a slightly less sweet flavor, which thus emphasizes the carbonation over the sweetness.  The mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing, and reminds me of good times and good things.  All my associations with Coke are positive.The 12 can Fridge Pack is a one of the numerous ways in which Coke can be purchased.  The biggest advantage to the Fridge Pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of Coke.  The only problem with the Fridge Pack is that you must remove one can of Coke when you open the box, so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it, if you plan on using the box as a dispenser.I still prefer 12 ounce cans over the various other size configurations because I can usually drink an entire can, thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink.  The two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of Coke, but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the Coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two; the same with the 20 ounce bottles, which I am unable to drink in one sitting.Coke remains our family favorite and my personal favorite, and while we have had forays into the other brands, we always come back to the classic original.

The cardboard pack even has a handy built in handle for you to carry them almost effortlessly!The idea of drinking coke in cans means that the soda doesn't loose its carbonation as it would if you bought a large bottle of soda. Each can remains completely fresh to the moment you open it to drink it. As for the \"fridge pack;\" you can load the cardboard pack into the fridge and just reach into it when you want a can of coke; and people like this. You can also remove the cans from the pack, of course, and then place the individual cans themselves into your refrigerator. The cans are also comparatively small so you can carry one or two with you in your car if you wish to take a long drive to get somewhere.The nutrition facts label can easily be found on the outside of the thin cardboard container that they call the actual \"fridge pack.\" Unfortunately, this beverage does contain caffeine as one of its ingredients so ask your doctor before drinking this soda if caffeine is a health concern for you. Coke also uses other ingredients so check out this nutrition facts label if any of the ingredients is a health concern for you.All in all, this is a wonderfully refreshing soft drink that many people enjoy for many good reasons.

Several different ones talked about how God had led them in different ways. It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, \"God...If you still speak to people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey.\" As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest thought to stop and buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz. He shook his head and said out loud, \"God is that you?\" He didn't get a reply and started on toward home. But again, the thought, buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz.

He could always use the Tuscan Whole Milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk and started off toward home.

At the next intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he said out loud, \"Okay, God, I will\".He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in semi commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst of neighborhoods either.

Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the Tuscan Whole Milk toward the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was crying.

Up until her heart gave out, Gran Gran basically kept her little farm out in Martel, South Dakota all by herself.  After Grampa Ilmuth died, she didn't want to move back to Huron with the rest of her family and, in her ever-proud manner, said she could run the farm all by herself.  For a good 20 years, she did, hiring help when she needed it and selling off parcels of it to make it easier to manage.  I remember being 6  years old and helping Gran Gran stake off her north side for sale to the developers.  She said that the money would let her keep the house.  I loved that old house and summers in Martel were something that I always looked forward to.  Raking the barns, milking the cows in the old Vaccar machine, feeding the chickens, and the bi-weekly trip to market to sell off produce and animals and get that black molasses candy.  I know a lot of folks have bad childhoods and all kinds of scars, but, you know, I wish every year on my birthday that I could be a kid again and get on that Greyhound bus back to Martel.Well, time changes everything.  A few years ago, Gran Gran had the first of several small heart attacks.  After spending a lot of time at the SCCI hospital in Bismarck, the doctors said she could go back home but she couldn't do any hard farm work anymore.  I think that is what really killed her.  She hired a few folks to do the chores and had to sell off a lot more land to cover those expenses.  I remember having to broker those deals, myself, and it was hard to let that land go...but, Gran Gran was getting better and I thought that it would get back to normal and we'd just have a smaller farm.  I had made arrangements to move into the guest room and manage the day to day affairs of the farm, but Gran Gran made a turn for the worse and had a stroke.  It took a long time after that for her to get strong enough to talk again and the doctors wanted her to stay  with her family or at a home so she could get her care.  I could tell by her eyes that she'd rather die than be a burden so we packed back up and moved back to the old farm, by now just a few acres of land and a barn with an old cow or two.  Gran Gran couldn't walk well, but she loved the radio and spent a long time talking in her now-slurred speech about the good old days and her husband.  I guess one of the blessings of age is the gentle curtain of nostalgia that can help hide the ravages of senility or stroke.  Anyways, she would start every day with a glass of fresh milk straight from the barn.  We had a pasteurization machine next to the Vaccar that was from 1965 and it was really nice to be able to get fresh cream and bottle it for gravy, butter or home-churned ice cream.  Gran Gran would drink that milk every day and she would always say she'd \"done since I was as tall as a grasshopper's knee and I'll do it till the day I die.\"  Well...the old cows finally died some 4 or 5 months later and, with taking care of a near-invalid, I didn't have time to keep up with the farm chores, anymore AND hunt down, buy and bring a cow back.  I started going out for groceries and putting them in the porch freezer so Gran Gran wouldn't know.  I'd pretend that the soup we had was made with our garden-fresh vegetables and the chicken was from our own coop.  She was lost in her aging mind and I guess she started thinking like it was 20 years ago again.  Her face would light up as she saw me cutting what she thought were her own carrots.  \"Gonna be a good harvest this year, if the carrots make it in before the first heavy rain,\" she'd say.I kept this up for about a year...then a nasty winter storm hit.  As always, there was a run on supplies and I wasn't able to find milk anywhere.  I was DEATHLY afraid that another shock to her nerves might be enough to put her in another situation and I cursed myself for building up her fantasy world that I couldn't keep up.  In desperation, I drove all the way back to Huron and got there about 2am.  Of course, not a single store in town was open and I went back to my cousin's house crying and half-dead myself from the fatigue of the effort.  It was then that Joey told me about ordering milk online from Amazon.com.  HEY!  Here was my answer!  I could order 2 weeks' worth at a time and it'd get delivered to the house so I wouldn't have to run all over McPherson county looking for milk.It came so fast by FedEx that I couldn't believe it!  Gran Gran had her glass of milk right up until she passed on and it gave me such a good feeling to make her last days comfortable and without worry that her beloved cows had died.THANK YOU, AMAZON, FOR LETTING US GET THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT ONLINE.

Ever since my aunt Fannie took me to a wonderful spa in Barstow (they used ONLY Tuscan milk in their treatments!) I've been dying to get my hands on this wholesome goodness in a bottle. It makes an incredible facial wash AND bath (please refer to my image #56 above, in the product description). If you're the organic type and want to avoid chemicals it makes the perfect skin wash that makes you feel clean and OH SO SOFT! It's been said that Cleopatra took milk baths, and there's a darned good reason she did. Amazing skin! THAT is what you get with Tuscan milk, and the more you use...the better! I honestly think my wrinkles are going away (my stomach seems flatter and my buttocks is tighter too!), people often comment on my \"creamy\" skin. A friend recently started using it as a hair conditioner, but I haven't tried it yet, will try it with my avocado/banana hair pack I'm mixing up in a few days. Highly recommended at ANY price! You'll need at least 16-20 gal. per milk bath, which may seem to be a bit pricey, but if you want to be a drop dead gorgeous as Cleopatra, it's worth it. Unfortunately, there's NO organic version of this fantastic milk (at the price you're paying it SHOULD BE!) but a little bovine recombinant growth hormone won't hurt your outsides as much as it will your insides.

I'm sure millions of kids who saw those commercials decided right then they needed a glass of milk. I haven't seen any of the commercials though.I was in Italy, drinking Italian milk. A geeky boy who spent hours playing role playing games and could tell you more than you ever needed to know about Jack Kirby's X-men. The sort of guy you would assume would grow up to be an adult man in my parents basement playing role playing games and spending my paychecks on comic books.After I graduated high school, I joined the Army like my step-dad. Lived in Germany for a while, then back stateside until I left the Army because I was all I could be.After a year back home, I sold almost everything I owned for a plane ticket to Alaska. After I was there for about a year, I met a lady on an online old-fashioned MBBS RPG. You know how sexy gamer girls are, this one was even more special. She was an exotic dancer with pink hair, the sort of person who would never be with geek like me.We got to know each other, and she threw herself at me. She didn't seem to realize that I was a total geek with a comic book habit. She said I looked like Tom Cruise on steroids, or was that Pee Wee Herman on Big Macs? I don't remember. We started dating, and she became my wife.These days? I'm a well-respected professional in my field, I make enough money to pay for all the comic books I want, and I have a gorgeous wife.I know it's because I drank milk, because I was lucky enough to be able to spend those formative years in Italy where Italian milk is easy to find.If you love your teens, this milk is well worth the price, it's worth any price.

So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern, rather than Southern, Europe, and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean. Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles, and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour, is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote, \"A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step\"?As for the question of color over origin, we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation.

We were about to embark on our yearly 3 hour boating tour and it was a relief that one of our errands- buying milk- was done with just a couple of clicks. (Back then, you see, Amazon was offering this product with the Amazon Prime option which set the delivery date for the day we were expected to return from vacation.)We arrived at the dock two days later to discover our usual yachting team had been replaced by a crew of two newbies. We assumed that they would work well together since they had chosen to dress in complementary shirts- blue for the portlier gentleman and red for his mate. Unfortunately, our confidence in the younger gentleman was premature- he turned out to be incompetent.The weather started getting rough. The tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew, the Minnow (our ship's name) would have been lost. We landed on an uncharted desert isle. The other passengers were quick to set up camp- under the direction of a  professor from the local community college (a fellow passenger- very bossy). However, we were too grief-strickened to participate in their survivalist activities. We knew that our milk- our glorious milk- would be delivered soon and that, without us around to place the jug into the refridgerator, we would be coming home to a curdled, smelly mess on our front porch.As the evening wore on, we decided to camp out on shore while our stranded companions slept in their huts. Just as my husband and I were about to nod off, drinking inferior cups of coconut milk for a nightcap, we noticed a glow on the horizon! A rescue boat! We were saved! As the boat pulled closer, we noticed that the captain of the ship was holding something above his head. As he came closer, we saw that it was a box labeled \"UPS\" and \"amazon.com\". Could it be?We swam out to sea and climbed into the rescue boat. The captain smiled at us as we joyfully tore open the package- Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz!! It was! We tilted our heads back and poured the contents into our grateful, dehydrated mouths! We toasted to our rescuers until the ship docked and we had returned to civilization!We found out later that our usual delivery man from UPS was the reason for our speedy rescue. After delivering our package to our vacant house in the morning, he became alarmed when he spotted the package still on the step later in the evening. He was responsible for the search and rescue party that found us- all to ensure that our Amazon delivery got to us in the two days! Oh, Prime!We never mentioned to anyone else that others in our party had survived the accident. How could we tell them that our gluttenous love of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz caused us to forget the others?

Sigh.........I guess, due to the refrigeration and QUICK shipment made necessary by the extremely perishable nature of this liquid, whole milk, make the high price a necessity.  I believe it originates in New Jersey, or another eastern state.  For those in the central or western areas of the country, (or heaven forbid, Canada or Europe!), this milk's shipping and handling charges will be totally prohibitive.......unless one wins the lottery, becomes a successful actress, actor, writer, musician, investor, model, CEO, etc. --  or marries a rich person who loves Tuscan Whole Milk as much as you do!So, for right now, at least, this delicious milk is out of my price-range, (double sigh!)  Luckily, my local supermarket DOES carry the next-best tasting milk: ORGANIC VALLEY.  It is expensive milk too, and I usually don't get it -- but it's quite delicious, and, whilst imbibing it, I can easily pretend it is the \"creme de la creme\" of milks: TUSCAN WHOLE MILK!PART II.....THE__DREAMPreface:  As many reviews here seem to be part of an amorphous \"Tuscan Whole Milk Creative Writing Contest\", I've decided to try my hand at it as well........I had won the lottery!  This was a very strange feeling for me -- because generally, I don't believe in even entering the lottery!  Though I DO enter the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes every chance I get, I've always felt that state lotteries, and especially mega-million lotteries, encompassing serveral states, were totally impossible for me to win.  So, I never bought a ticket for any lottery.  This did not, however, stop my best friend from buying a ticket for me for my birthday.  One ticket.  And it won!  It won me $738 million dollars....and twenty-three cents!I had always thought that if I came into a lot of money, the first thing I would do is ask Warren Buffet if I could consult with him on the best way to invest it.  However, the first thing I REALLY did, was go to my computer, go to Amazon.com, and order thirty-five gallons of Tuscan Whole Milk, (I like to put in a big supply of things, because prices keep going up), plus a mew refrigerator and freezer to put them in, as my current 15-cubic foot refrigerator-freezer seemed woefully inadequate to store all that milk.  All of these things arrived within the next two weeks -- two weeks which had been busy with TV interviews, meetings with lawyers, and the discovery of about 3,000 new relatives of whom I had never heard before.....It just so happened that, just after my new refrigerator and freezer, and thirty-five gallons of delicious TUSCAN Whole Milk had arrived, I happened to turn on the TV, and discovered that Mr. Warren Buffet was making a visit to the town where I live!  I put in a call to his hotel room and was lucky enough to actually talk to Mr. Buffet himself! (The MSN article had unwittingly divulged the name of the hotel at which hotel Mr. Buffet was staying, in the initial appearance of the article...though the information disappeared within fifteen minutes on the screen, when a hasty re-write of the article, minus hotel revelation, appeared).  Mr. Buffet was kind, and thoughtful, and immediately put me totally at ease.  He even offered to come to MY home, instead of my travelling to his hotel!With my new personal assistant, I hastily set up the dining room table, with food that I HOPED Mr. Buffet would like: smoked salmon, hamburgers and rolls, lemon sole, (he could take his pick!), and 7-layer cake, served with coffee and, (proudly), with my new Tuscan Whole milk.....When Mr. Buffet arrived, I felt I had re-met an old friend.  He was so unassuming and natural!  Happily, I led him to the dining room table, hoping that the food would put us even more at ease.  I looked forward, not only to \"drinking in\" his advice, but also to the beautiful platters arranged on the table.However, when Mr. Buffet saw what was on the table, he audibly gasped.  I was afraid he was having a heart-attack, and came immediately to his aid.\"That....that MILK!\" he gasped.  \"You threw away money on THAT milk!  It's $129 a gallon!  How...how could you?  How could ANYONE?\"With that, he stormed out of my house.I've had a lot of fun and adventures, with my lottery winnings.

He was only three and a half years old but the pain in his voice was unmistakable and pure, the way it always tends to be with children of a young age. \"My cereal... milk... I need milk...\"I knew then that this was a serious matter. I'd been there before myself. A victim of an unfortunate circumstance decades prior where the last bit of Cinnamon Toast Crunch I had poured myself had been tainted by the last bit of milk we had left in the house. Milk that had turned nearly three days prior. I realized it after the second spoonful, tasting what seemed to me like a mixture of old, sharp cheese and cinnamon toast.It didn't help matters either to picture myself pouring the last of the milk into my coffee that morning without a second thought. I was usually good about things like that, leaving enough of something in particular for those still in the house when I left for work every morning. But that morning, the call of milk for my coffee was too great.I gripped the phone tightly, the work in front of me long forgotten. I knew I'd have to make a stop at the supermarket on the way home. How much time did I have to wipe away the grief from his undeniably broken heart? I figured I had about an hour, maybe fifty minutes if I left right then and there.\"I'll get you your milk, Stephen.\" I said. \"I'll get you your milk. You can count on it.\"I heard him sniffle once or twice before he handed the phone back to my wife. I knew what she was going to say just as much as I had already known what it was that I had to do.I had to make things right.I stepped off the subway nearly two hours later. A normal day would've guaranteed no more than an hour long ride to get home but I didn't take the blizzard we had just been socked with into account. I spent at least twenty minutes at Times Square with another forty minutes added to the ride at 96th Street. The veins in my temple were throbbing as I walked into the supermarket, flurries of snow falling from my hair and shoulders. The place was a disaster. I saw two women to my left fighting over a length of kielbasa, venom spitting from their mouths in hushed tones. I uttered a silent prayer, hoping I wouldn't find the same sort of scene in the dairy section. I turned into the cool air of the dairy aisle and stopped in my tracks when I saw that there was no milk left.Up until then, I'd never experienced those moments you see in the movies, the ones where all the sound goes out, replaced by only a thudding heartbeat and a high pitched tone that sounds like someone just flatlined in the ER, another recently departed poor soul in a history of departed poor souls. But right then I did. I knew I'd be able to go to a local bodega and get a gallon of milk there but there was something in that moment that defeated me. Old memories flared up and for a moment, strange yet almost comforting in its familiarity, I could taste the rancid, sour sweet taste of dead milk in the back of my throat. The image of me dropping to my knees and screaming up at the ceiling filled my mind and seemed to be in my immediate future when a flash of movement from the rear of the store caught my eye, stopping all train of thought.A flash of white color.I started moving through the aisle, pushing past an old man trying to make sense of the day's offerings in the circular. The man I saw emerge from the back of the supermarket was wearing a white butcher's coat, stained with long dried blood from the day's work. I felt a sense of disappointment, believing that I'd fallen victim to my own hopes, that is, until I looked down. He was pushing a hand truck, loaded with crates of fresh Tuscan milk stacked on top of one another.Sound rushed back into my world, the sound of my heartbeat retreating to the back of the auditorium that was my everyday world. I didn't exactly storm over to him but my footsteps thudded on the ground, footsteps of a man with a mission.I yanked a gallon out of the crate by the handle, feeling the ice cold milk inside greet me with its coolness. I knew what it would taste like because I'd had it before, not just once but many times over the course of my life. It was the perfect thing to add to a bowl of cereal and better yet, it was still fresh with at least another week and a half to go before it would turn. More than enough time to get home to my son so he could have his cereal in the proper fashion. With good old fashioned, vitamin D laced milk.\"Thank you,\" I said to the man in the white coat, patting him on the back and ending it with a hearty squeeze of the shoulder. \"Thank you.\" He stood there, not really knowing what to say for a moment before beginning to restock the milk section. He never took his eyes from me but I think he knew. He knew that there was more at stake here than what it looked like. The milk wasn't for me and he knew that. Maybe he had a boy of his own, maybe not. But he knew.On the way home, I felt a sense of relief. I'd gotten Stephen his milk and the people at Tuscan would be happy to know that they helped a little boy get the smile on his face back. I smiled.Above, the snow continued to fall from the sky.

I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to \"kick up\" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.After taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar but a hint of sugar and garlic. Top rated by many.2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers3) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce (milder and with less vinegar)4) Huichol Hot Sauce (milder - less vinegar - not so widely available)5) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar)I hope I've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this onePS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a \"plus\" in my view but rather a \"minus\" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.UPDATE ----- A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out: While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.What sauce came in FIRST? ------ Huy Fong Sriracha.What sauce came in very LAST? ---- TabascoI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.Tastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Well know but FAR from the best.

I really did.But after branching out and trying other sauces, I can't help but see how flawed it is.  And I think its popularity is due not to its quality, but due to it being a recognizable brand.The quality shockingly isn't as high as you might think.  In fact, I find it to be quite low-quality.  After sampling many other sauces in the past few months (I'm going through a hot-sauce kick lately), Tabasco in retrospect comes off as quite cheap-tasting and with no real flavor.  And the burn isn't natural.  It tastes \"chemically.\"  Mainly due to the fact that all you taste is vinegar.  And to me, that's not the mark of a good sauce.  A good sauce should have a natural burn (moreso like fire or radiating heat) and a nice flavor to it.  It shouldn't taste too vinegary and it definitely shouldn't have an artificial-feeling \"chemically\" burn.  But that's what Tabasco really tastes like when I really pay attention and analyze it.Just to make my analysis more fair and up-to-date, tonight I decided to do a taste-test with it and some of the others sauces I had on hand.  I used about six different sauces in comparable amounts.  Straight to the tongue.  (With a \"cool down\" period in between so I could clear my mouth out of the burn and flavor)  And classic Tabasco was the worst in terms of flavor.  I hate to say that, because I know its popular due to its recognizable nature.  But it was the worst by far.  To the point I almost just tossed the whole bottle in the trash, because I don't see myself using it ever.  I didn't, since I figured I should have it on-hand for friends who may want some.  But I definitely won't be using it again.I'm quite saddened by how poorly classic Tabasco holds up.  But don't get me wrong.  I do like some of their other available flavors a little bit.  (I think their Chipotle sauce is ok, because it at least has a slight touch of flavor, though again, it's far too \"vinegary\" for its own good.)

We simply had the basics -- salt, pepper, a little sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, lemon juice, garlic, ketchup, mustard, homemade pepper sauce, and Lea & Perrins. For us bought sauce in a bottle was only Lea & Perrins.  Nothing else could be substituted. Less expensive brands never tasted quite right to us.We lovingly placed that bottle with its brown paper cover on the cabinet shelf.  I suppose it would have been fine to remove the paper, but with reverence we kept our \"wooster\" covered.On the special occasions when we ate grilled steak, we thought there was only one steak sauce - Lea & Perrins.  I have no reason to promote this product.  My comments are not in any way solicited.  I simply want to tell you what tastes good.When I married at a young age, my mother-in-law, Mary, led me into a new adventure of cooking and tasting the wonderful flavors of food.  She cooked the best okra and tomatoes in the world.  Like my family, she could use only one brand of Worcestershire sauce.Mom's Okra And Tomatoes2 medium onionsSome olive oil16 ounces frozen sliced okra2 small cans or 1 large can tomatoes2-3 teaspoons Lea & Perrins Worchestershire sauce cup Heinz ketchup1 teaspoon sugar or equivalent amount of sugar substitute2 teaspoons vinegarSeasoned saltBlack pepperCrushed red pepperChop the onions into big chunks. Saut&eacute; them in a little olive oil. If the tomatoes are whole, slice them. Add the tomatoes, okra, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sugar, and vinegar to the onions and olive oil.Bring the mix to a boil and season to taste with seasoned salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Don't add extra sugar, which would ruin the taste; do add extra ketchup if you need it.Simmer the mixture until the okra is cooked enough. It should be firm, not mushy. Check the seasoning and add more as needed, but don't get started eating it.

I mentioned this because I drink 3 cups of coffee every day- the calories can add up pretty fast.Coffee mate also contains trans fats - one of the ingredients is Mono- and diglycerides - these are agents used to extend the shelf life and we also see them in foods which have trans fats, which have been bad. It also contains hydrogenated fats which is linked to heart disease.

Sherwin", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.I would use vanilla caramel Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.Overall, vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use.

These are NOT grade A molasses either. One tbsp of organic molasses offers me 20% iron, 10% calcium which is more than milk's calcium since milk's calcium is fortified, molasses calcium is not, 20% potassium, 8% magnesium, and 10% copper. With 40~60 calories and 10~13gr sugar, I only use one tbsp a day in my green tea daily as well as when I am in need of fast energy, without any additives. Potassium stops cramps and this is a life saver. Once opened, I place some in a smaller tightly sealed container and keep it in refrigerator, refill as needed, but consume it in less than 6 months. I am into sports, diet and nutrition and blackstrap molasses' nutritional value varies depending on the quality of the sugar cane or beets from which it was extracted. For that reason organic and brand is extremely important to me. Honey loses its medicinal value when added to tea but since molasses is a by-product which is heated during the production so further heat does not impact the nutritional value. With all that said, you will still need to get used to the taste since the taste is somewhere around bitter, beet juice and changes the taste of the tea.

They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.Ritz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.Overall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime.

Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.On my own, I've been taste testing hot sauces, unaware of Roberts or an entire movement of \"chili-heads\". I've purchased about 40 hot sauces and began taste testing them - day after day - week after week - writing up notes. (Everyone needs a hobby)What I found is Cholula is one of the best and it is in my top tier! BTW: make sure you DON'T purchase one of the Cholula variants that add lime or garlic or chipotle to the mix - get the \"Original\".Taste: I'd call this sauce low to medium heat. You'll need a few heavy drops for a Bloody Mary and more for a family sized dish. But it is not so hot that a few extra drops will ruin a dish. It has a nice blend of tastes and as noted, low to medium heat. There is a bit of sweetness, some vinegar and overall this blend is quite good. However, unless you have taste tested a number of different hot sauces you may not appreciate how good this one is. It simply does its job nicely, adds some heat to a dish without adding any off-tastes. If you have taste tested a number of hot sauces you will detect some vinegar but no where near the overpowering presence of this stuff which ruins so many other hot sauces.There are a dizzying array of hot sauces available on the internet but most are difficult to find and expensive to purchase (given shipping costs). This sauce is readily available not just here on Amazon but also in your local grocery store too. That fact alone should encourage you to try it.My other four favorites are: the often recommended Huy Dong -  Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (readily available on Amazon and in stores). Keep in mind  - it is MUCH hotter with a hint of garlic and no vinegar (a plus in my book). Next is Huichol Hot Sauce (hard to find but similar -- yet better - than Cholula), Tabasco's Chipotle (also fairly mild with the rich smoked taste of the Chipotle pepper) and finally El Yucatan Jalapeno Hot Sauce.ADVISORY: This sauce does its job quite nicely which is to add some heat to any dish. Does it magically make a mediocre dish better. No! What it does do is add some heat without introducing any off -tastes. Now, to many, that may seem to be \"a given\" but the truth is very few hot sauces actually do that.One last tip -  this sauce is sold in a 12 oz and a much larger size and these larger sizes are often the far better buy!And a final word of Warning: Watch out for sellers that get to the top of Amazon's sellers list by offering a low product cost and then make up for this with high shipping charges on a per bottle basis (regardless of how many bottles you order at one time). Check your shipping costs just prior to confirming your order. They may be much higher than you were lead to believe, even if the seller publishes a shipping chart.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One of the Best. Low/Medium heat - great blend.

For the record the cuisine with which I am most familiar is Baja, but I have been served this sauce in restaurants all over the US, as well as some of the Mexican border towns.True, it is not very spicy. What it is, though, is flavorful. Also, unlike Tabasco, peppers dominate the flavor instead of vinegar. But the best thing is how it manages to enhance any dish from seafood to soups and main courses.I mentioned that this is not very spicy - that is a relative statement. One person's spicy is another person's bland. This is not as spicy as Tabasco, but is a little spicier than a pickled jalapeno pepper. If you want truly spicy sauce with a good flavor you will probably have to try an Asian sauce likeABC Indonesian Extra Hot Chili Sauce - Sambal Extra Pedasor a North African/Mediterranean sauce likeHarissa Paste. You will get the heat and flavor with those, but you will lose that ineffable flavoring that is truly a flavor of Mexico.The bottom line is if you love Mexican cuisine this sauce brings out the best in any dish with which you would use a hot sauce.

It was a delicious flavorful alternative to equally delicious homemade hot cocoa for special occasions. I have never been satisfied with easy or \"instant\" methods of making plain hot cocoa. They just can't compete with the richness of heavy cream and melted chocolate. But my Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait met its match in Ghirardelli's Chocolate Mocha. This is a wonderful powdered mix of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.The instructions tell you to mix 3 tablespoons of Ghirardelli's Chocolate Mocha with 8 oz (1 cup) of milk, heat, and serve. I find that 2 tablespoons with 2/3 cup of milk fills the average cup or mug. And I always use half-and-half instead of milk. Topped with sweetened whipped cream, this makes a decadent, filling dessert that rivals homemade and restaurant beverages and is attractive enough to serve to guests. Serve with a spoon for those who like to eat the whipped cream before it all melts into the chocolate.Ghirardelli provides microwave and stovetop directions. The microwave instructions advise heating the milk for 1-1 1/2 minutes before adding the Chocolate Mocha mix. I don't think the 2-step process is necessary, but if you've ever tried to heat milk or half-and-half in a microwave, you know how quickly it can get out of hand. One second nothing is happening; the next second the milk has bubbled all over the floor of your oven, leaving little in the cup. If you want to heat the hot chocolate in the microwave, you can add the Chocolate Mocha mix before you heat the milk, but don't take your eyes off of it once you start heating. If you see any bubbles, stop the microwave immediately, stir the drink, and heat more as necessary.

This might be better named \"Double Sugar\" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.First, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed.

(Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with \"chocolat chaud\" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout!Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a \"bowl of soul,\" a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others.

Then he adds the liquid to the food he is marinating.When possible he allows at least 4 hours for all the delicious flavors to be absorbed.  He turns the meat or fish occasionally.He adjusts the amounts as needed for the amount of food being prepared.--With the prices of everything going up, it is necessary to save money any way we can.

It does not supply any vitiamins according to the label, but I suspect it does have some nutritional value that we just don't know about.  It is excellent on collard greens, and as the authors of The Collard Patch we use it on our collards.Here in Louisiana we can beat Amazon's price on this product.  I don't know whether Crystal is available throughout the country and how the prices compare.To us the bottle is a work of art, and we are delighted to serve it on our table.  We take Crystal with us sometimes if we eat in public places that do not have enough seasoning.  We are discreet about adding it because we would not want to offend a chef.

Peregrine Cavendish sailed from the protection of the Leeward Islands, controlled of course by His Majesty's Royal Navy (the finest Navy on all the high seas!), the waters of the Lesser Antilles were patrolled by a cacophony of Spanish Armada's and Dutch Privateers.  Just two weeks prior we had commandeered the Dutch ship Eendracht, and it's Captain, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, under legally sanctioned duress (we Englishman always operate within the law), told of a Dutch fort with an \"embarrassment of riches\" on the Dutch island of La Tortuga.  Long known for it's rich salt deposits, First Mate Tignor, a fine military tactician, drew up a brilliant assault plan upon the La Tortuga.We approached through the dense tropical jungle, with First Mate Tignor on point.  We made sure our muskets were loaded, for the assault had a high probability of bloodshed.  But prepared we all were.  \"I never liked em Dutchies, a bunch of nancies them be\", bellowed Midshipman Householder.  \"Let me at em, Skipper, and I swear I'll make the King Proud.\"  We tipped further until they reached the base of the outer wall of the Dutch fort.  We threw our grappling hooks over the outer wall, and prepared for our siege.As soon as they descended the wall, they heard the distinct screams, of.... a damsel!\"With your authority skipper, I call onesies on the damsel\", First Mate Tignor asked.\"You have my authority First Mate Tignor, you will rescue her and meet us back here in thirty-six minutes\", I responded.\"For England\", called First Mate Tignor.\"For the King\", I answered.And with that, First Mate Tignor took off.As he followed the sullen screams of the fair maiden's call, First Mate Tignor found his pathway blocked by six unsavory Dutch buccaneers.\"A filthy Englishman\", gruffed the tall one, \"we ought to slit his throat right here\".Their leader, a unshaven, slightly portly fellow spoke next.  \"My name is Lord Petr Laars Oxidant, of Rotterdam.  I'm the ranking officer of this outpost, and you have just unfairly angered me.  I'll gladly draw swords with an Englishman as filthy as you\".  And with that, Captain Petr Laars Oxidant unsheathed his cutlass.First Mate Tignor was faster on the draw, as his cutlass, forged by pure Japanese steel, a gift from the Samurai King of Eto, flew out from his side and plunged deep within the chest of the gruff, tall Dutchman.  With the speed and precision of a bolt of lightning, First Mate Tignor dispatched three more of the Dutch.  One of the remaining Dutchman fled terrified, as all are well aware of the fear and cowardice of the Dutch.  All that stood between First Mate Tignor and the fair maiden was Lord Petr Laars Oxidant.\"It is a good day to die\", exclaimed First Mate Tignor, as he volleyed a thrust of Lord Oxidant's cutlass.  Swish.  Miss.  Clink.  Blocked.  Whirrrrr.  Lord Oxidant's cutlass just barely missed First Mate Tignor's ear.\"You have skill, Englishman\", Lord Oxidant growled, \"but you still have much to learn.  You see, the Dutch are a proud nation, built upon the pillars of faith, country, honor, freedom and...\"Before Lord Oxidant could finish his speech, First Mate Tignor thrust the cutlass deep through Lord Oxidant's callous heart.  At the very moment, a lost and confused Boson's Mate Micklegal stumbled upon the swashbuckling duo a half seconds time before the fatal blow.  Boson's Mate Micklegal knelt down next to Lord Oxidant's lifeless body and retrieved a pouch of green tea leaves from his coat.  \"From henceforth\", Boson's Mate Micklegal decreed, \"let this tea be known as \"Anti-Oxidant Green Tea\".  Oh that clever Boson's Mate Micklegal.Boson's Mate Micklegal followed First Mate Tignor to the rear wall, and helped as First Mate Tignor cut the restraints above the fair maiden's hands.\"My hero\", the fair maiden cried, \"I owe you my life kind sir, for I am Lady Jasmine, of Port Royal, daughter of Lord Sydney Olivier, Governor of Jamaica.\"\"Well my lady\", First Mate Tignor said as he tipped his hat and kneeled, \"First Mate Tignor, of Portsmouth, England, at your service\".  First Mate Tignor thrust his arms around Lady Jasmine and tossed her over his shoulder as she giggled. \"Welcome to the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, my lady\", he chuckled, a wink in his eye.The crew rejoiced upon the deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.  The treasure at the Dutch Fort, or, that that remained of the treasure were a barrel of oranges, a few spices, and an odd fruit unfamiliar to us.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, his trusty kettle in hand, decided tea would be most proper.  He placed the Anti Oxidant green tea leaves into the kettle, and added the zest of the orange.  But Boson's Mate Micklegal believed the tea was missing something.  He placed the spice and the essence of the strange fruit into the kettle as well.\"What do you call this type of tea Boson's Mate Micklegal?\", I asked, \"It surely cannot be Earl Grey\".  (As all fine Englishman know, that Earl Grey Tea, \"The Earl\", is the finest tea in His Majesty's empire, truly the tea of Kings.)Boson's Mate Micklegal glanced over at First Mate Tignor and Lady Jasmine.  \"Well Captain, the fruit is called 'The Fruit of Passion', in honor of that\", pointing at First Mate Tignor and Lady Jasmine.  \"And the spice, well, that's Jasmine Spice Captain.\"  I gave Boson's Mate Micklegal a courteous smile.That night, in a sleepwalk, Boson's Mate Micklegal found a bottle of fine Glen Fiddych, stowed away in the hold, consumed it, and then set the oranges, fruit of passion, and Jasmine spice ablaze on the aft deck so that he could toast his baguette.  Oh well, such is life in the Lesser Antilles.I had forgotten of this deep and fruit infused tea for many years, until a fellow of mine brewed me a fine cup of Green Tea with Orange, Passionfruit and Jasmine made by the hacks at Lipton, that was spot on.

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.(From the Twinings website: \"When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.\")Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.)

Buckwheat Honey when raw, has more nutrients since it is unpasteurized and not force filtered, to deliver the highest possible levels of enzymes, vitamins and minerals. Raw honey tastes different than filtered or process honey but more importantly majority of raw honey are in solid form not liquid unless you apply heat or do not store properly. Dutch Gold is not raw, it is filtered and although it tastes like buckwheat since it is from buckwheat flower, an acquired taste, processing takes out the nutrients and that is why it is not in a solid form but liquid form. Dutch Gold is more reputable company than most regardless. Raw Tupelo honey is in liquid form, rare but that is how Tupelo is but Buckwheat in solid form.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for \"ultrapurified,\" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Honey helps kill the bacteria that may cause infection. When honey comes into contact with damaged skin, it triggers the production of antibacterial hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the sugars in honey mean there is little space for water molecules (bacteria need water to survive, so reducing the amount available makes it hard for them to thrive). Dabbing on honey or a sprinkling of sugar can deprive the bacteria of water, which ultimately destroys them.

Consistency is extremely important when using such a condiment, which by nature, is typically consumed a few drops at a time.  I&#8217;ve used soy sauces where there was a dark colored liquid, but virtually no flavor, and others on the opposite side of the spectrum where it appears the bottle was filled with some sort of atomic sodium.For a mass produced product, Kikkoman still employs one ingredient most corporations avoid; time.  In an age where vinegar is distilled in a matter of hours, and vanilla extract produced in a day or so, Kikkoman still brews this sauce for months.  I&#8217;m sure there are scientific ways to accelerate this process, but the mellowing allowed via the passage of time is still favored for this particular sauce.  Considering the length of manufacturing this appears to be quite a value as well for a half gallon.  Just store it in the dark, as soy sauce doesn&#8217;t like the light and you should have a ready supply for quite some time.The product arrived in an easily handled two quart bottle with a flip top lid that covers a  inch hole.  Obviously (I hope this is obvious) an orifice this size is for filling soy dispensers or use in a commercial kitchen, and not as a dispensing device for your plate of rice.  Yet I have this feeling that more than one person has used a half gallon container for this purpose, flooded their meal with the stuff, then blamed the sauce.  If this is your first experience with bulk soy sauce, then supplement your table with a small dispenser.  Ceramic or porcelain make good choices since they keep the light out, and the insulating qualities of those materials keep the sauce relatively cool, which maintains the flavor profile and shelf life.So after many years of sampling various sauces, I have arrived at this station of being a&#8230; Kikko-man.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I&#8217;ll admit it; I&#8217;m now a soy sauce snob.", "unixReviewTime": 1374710400, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2013"}

It makes a great Bloody/Virgin Mary and will add some interesting flavors to any dish that needs some heat. As another reviewer said -- this is probably the best tasting product within Tabasco's ever expanding lineup.I've taste tested 7 different Chipotle hot sauces and the Tabasco Chipotle is one of my favorites. The taste is very rich, smokey, semi-sweet and, for once, there is not too much vinegar! Yet make no mistake - there is a good dose of vinegar yet it is not over powering. It is quite simply one of the best Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.Keep in mind that this sauce is relatively mild when compared to the other Tabasco products.  In this particular sauce, the heat is far more subdued and not what I would have  expected from a Tabasco product. This sauce needs to viewed as a completely different product.  This is the best tasting Tabasco sauce I've ever tasted and beyond that -- near the best tasting Chipotle I have found.I paid $3.29 for it at my local supermarket. I doubt you'll have any trouble finding it locally and since tastes differ - I'd recommend you first buy a single bottle close to home. Then purchase a half gallon on-line.What sets this chipotle apart is the richness of its flavor. It is concentrated in the best possible sense. Rich, with some sweetness, smokey, some vinegar and a bit of gentle heat.I have repeatedly taste tested the following Chipotle:  Tabasco, La Victoria, El Pato, Cholula, Goya, Bufalo and El Yucateco.The El Yucateco Chipotle is also superb and the only worthy competitor to this sauce. Both are rich - the Tabasco has more vinegar and the El Yucateco has a bit more sugar and a hint of tomato.Update: My favorite blend turns out to be tomato juice, a fairly heavy dose of Tabasco Chipotle plus a bit of Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. I also add a dash of Worchester sauce and lemon juice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tabasco's Best.

Organic, naturally processed, from California, great price, awesome reviews. I was hoping I'd find a full bodied balanced tasty olive oil to take the place of my expensive olive oils from Spain. Please note, I am a sommelier and have a pretty refined palate. Just like with my wines I look for balance. I don't mind acidity, I don't mind bitterness, I don't mind a bit of fresh herbaceous taste. Balance for me is key. I like my olive oil to be  rich, nutty, and full of balanced flavor. Fruity, buttery, earthy, peppery are all good ...again they need to be in balance.This oil is way too overtop green and grassy tasting. If you like the taste of wheat grass juice then this will be up your alley. I pored an ounce in a dish and just dipped my bread in it. Full bodied, very grassy, good acidity, with a long somewhat bitter finish. Maybe made into a dressing you can hide some of these overpowering unbalanced favors. Who knows these flavors might even signify a healthier olive oil with more antioxidants? I'll pass. I am returning the olive oil and sticking to what I know I like.Update: I hate wasting food and the thought of  returning the Item did not sit right because I knew the item would just be thrown in the trash. So I tried to see if I can use the item for cooking and not straight out of the bottle. Tonight I grabbed four medium tomatoes from my veggie garden, two cloves of garlic, 1.5 ounces of the olive oil, salt and pepper. I heated the oil in a skillet, sliced the tomatoes and added them to the hot oil, added the crushed garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Cooked over the stove top for 3-4 minutes at high heat while occasionally stirring. I then added a few eggs to the mixture , put the lid on the skillet, and let the eggs poach in this thick tomato sauce for 5 minutes. Finally I added an ounce of crumbled feta cheese at the end. Had this for dinner with some Ezekiel bread tonight. Very yummy! The olive oil's over the top grassy flavors were masked by all the other ingredients.

This tea is no exception.Most of the Twinings Darjeeling blend is black, but you can spot some green particles. The Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses smaller, less-expensive particles which infuse more quickly than whole leaves.The Twinings tea has enough tannins to tolerate milk or a sweetener. It has some harshness when infusing is done at too high a temperature or for too long.If you drink tea without additions, I suggest steeping not more than 2.5 to 3 minutes to control bitterness. You may even want to check every 15 seconds starting at two minutes, since Darjeeling can quickly 'bolt' to a point of unpleasant sharpness. To avoid particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)To gain the best flavor, I recommend brewing at a temperature of 185F or cooler. (A clean candy or meat thermometer can quickly guide your efforts.) If you have been brewing with water that is near boiling, you will be shocked by the huge transformation from using water that cools a couple minutes after reaching the boiling point.I have enjoyed quality Darjeeling, the 'champagne of teas,' for over three decades. And, how do I rate Twinings? A bargain. If your enjoy Twinings, I suggest trying some other Darjeeling teas, perhaps estate grown. The better Darjeeling teas come from the higher elevations where the cooler mountain environment slows leaf growth and develops a fine flavor. Where should you search? Check reviews at Amazon and other sellers. Among the brands packaged in tins, I love Peets - normally known for their coffees. Additionally, Lipton Darjeeling Tea (Green Label) bulk tea is a quite good and is inexpensively priced at Indian food markets. The Lipton package has a packing date, and if you can find tea packed past within the past 6 months you will be most delighted.

Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The King of Teas.", "unixReviewTime": 1100044800, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2004"}

I had to use a lot more of it than I do with pure stevia, and I realized why when I examined the product label and researched information on the product on the NuNaturals website. This product is mostly maltodextrin. This is what is stated in the product information from NuNaturals: \"Add NuStevia to sweeten your favorite food or beverage, 1/4 tsp is as sweet as 1 tsp of sugar. For recipes, 4 tbs [1/4 cup] is as sweet as 1 cup of sugar.\"Pure stevia powder is presumed to be 200 times as sweet as sugar. Individual perceptions of sweetness may vary, but I personally find the best brands of pure stevia to be about 40 times as sweet as sugar. Given that the stevia powder used in this product is at best, per the company's own admission, only about 4 times as sweet as sugar, that means that this product is only about one-tenth stevia.For my own consumption, I much prefer to purchase100% pure stevia powder. I'm not a fan of maltodextrin mixed with stevia, and certainly not of natural flavors added to any food I consume which are, for reasons unknown, added to this product. I explain what those ingredients are below.Ingredients: Maltodextrin, stevia extract and natural flavors. Free of soy, MSG, yeast, gluten, wheat, milk, synthetics, artificial colors or flavors, preservatives, saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, or artificial sweeteners.Maltodextrin: This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet. It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler, to improve the texture and appearance in processed food. As a relatively cheap ingredient, it can also add more bulk to a given product, thereby increasing profits for the company using it. In the U.S., most of the time it is derived from rice, corn, or potato starch. Through a process called hydrolysis, the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids. Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further, resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water. Products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin are required by law to say \"wheat\" in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: \"The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional\" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1383955200, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2013"}

Black Ceylon tea was what they called it. Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever.

I don't brush everyday (yeah, like I actually want to admit it!) and have always brushed with mainstream brands like Crest, Colgate's, Aim, etc.One month, I had to go to the dentist to get my root canal cleaned and the dentist said I would likely have to come back in 3 months because of another root canal problem and would likely have to lose another tooth.  Then a week later while shopping for indian food in an indian grocery, they also had neem toothpaste (which I had never heard of) made in India for Indians with the Indian grocery owner SWEARING that Indians rarely go to dentists because their #1 protection is brushing with neem.  I've been brushing with neem toothpaste ever since then.  Well, it's been OVER 2 YEARS and I still haven't had to go back to the dentist.  Neem in the toothpaste certainly is my DENTAL SAVIOR.  The toothpaste has mint flavor added to freshen the breath but it has a garlicky taste/smell (because of the neem) but i'm more than willing to brush with it rather than having anymore wasteful painful/time-consuming/expensive dental visits.  I no longer use any of the mainstream toothpastes like Crest, Colgate, Aim, etc. and am either thinking of throwing them away or donating them to charity.  Toothpastes with neem are definitely worth the $$$'s!!  Neem is also used regularly in skin and hair products and give better results (with lotions, oils, soaps, shampoo, etc. for conditions such as lice, fleas, dandruff, eczema, etc.) compared to our American mainstream products.I don't know why our mainstream researchers and/or dental companies don't talk about neem.  At (...) is one link of research on neem for dentistry.  I guess it's more profitable for them to keep us hooked on putting our \"dental lives\" on fluoride and having to go back to pay $$$'s for more dental visits and more dental products than it is to let people know there are better foreign products out there used by other just as intelligent humans in far off lands. We Americans call our society advanced but when I compare our society with societies like India where the people have a LONG history for THOUSANDS of years of rarely needing dentists/doctors because they have learned through experience what herbs and other natural products will help them medically, then I begin to realize how greedy profit-driven, short-sighted, arrogant, blind, narcisstic and  more importantly FALLIBLE our society's mainstream \"science\" and \"medicine\" is.-------------UPDATE: I've been using the non-SLSHerbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 OuncesAT THE SAME TIME ON EVERY TOOTHBRUSHING withTrader Joe's Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis & Myrrhfor over a month to increase my anti-cavity/anti-plaque/gum healing protection and I've got to say that my mouth has never tasted/felt fresher and cleaner and I FOR SURE know I don't need to go to any dentist (no gum bleeding, no pain in my gums/teeth) and the toothpastes together are not as abrasive as when I use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste with either one. The problem I had with Auromere's toothpaste was because it had no SLS, it was hard to spread it in all the corners of my mouth on every tooth but when I added Trader Joe's Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better. So in the 2 combinations of toothpaste, everytime I brush my teeth, I know my teeth and gums are protected by:-neem (which helps prevent plaque with antimicrobial properties which can treat periodontal disease and reverse gingivitis)-and other healing herbsand from theTrader Joe's Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis & Myrrh, I know my teeth and gums are protected by:-myrrh (which helps fight infection of mouth and gums. Has a stimulating effect on the gums)-and propolis which is a sticky substance gathered by bees from the leaf buds of trees and plastered over hives for strength which is also an antibiotic and antiseptic that helps fight infections of the throat and mouth and speeds healing of gums.

So, I tried it.  It tastes okay - not as good as traditional soy sauce, but a decent substitute in recipes calling for it.  I used it for a few weeks before finally looking more closely at the label.  Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 920mg of sodium per serving.  Low Sodium Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 575mg per serving.  Bragg's has 160mg per serving.  However, all the soy sauces I checked have a serving size of one tablespoon.  Bragg's serving size is HALF A TEASPOON!  This makes it 960mg in an equivalent serving - more than regular soy sauce!  I was shocked, and then angry.Every \"substitute\" product - whether low fat, low sodium, higher fiber, whatever - I have ever tried before now has the same serving size as the product it is recommended in place of.  Not only is this not equivalent, it is a ridiculous serving size. I could not find another liquid condiment of any type (ketchup, mustard, steak sauce, salad dressing, ginger sauce, etc.) that had a serving size smaller than one tablespoon, and many are two tablespoons.  Not only is regular soy sauce lower in sodium, but obviously the low sodium options from name brands like Kikkoman or La Choy are significantly lower.There are many other seasoning options that are lower in sodium than this.  If you like the taste, that is one thing.  However, if you are looking to lower your sodium intake this is not a good product.

That discrepancy exists in the real-world markets of most cities also; allspice from an Indian or Caribbean specialty store will cost a fraction of what you'd pay in a 'gringo' supermarket. There may be some subtle grades of quality in allspice berries, and certainly freshness has to be considered, but freshness can hardly be guaranteed when you're shopping on-line, no more for the expensive than for the cheap product.Allspice powder loses its potency very quickly. A 1.5 ounce jar of the powder would be suitable only for those who know they'll use it up in a couple of weeks max. Obviously a whole pound of allspice berries is orders of magnitude for many home chefs also. Know thyself! At this price, it's worth cultivating a taste for the stuff!Allspice is the berry of a shrub, Pimenta dioica, a kind of myrtle. The berries look a lot like peppercorns but have a very different flavor. The shrub seems to have originated in the Caribbean, and accordingly allspice is a major ingredient in the spice melange of Caribbean cookery, especially Jamaican, included in virtually all barbeque sauces. It's also used generously in some \"Middle Eastern\" cuisines. Oddly, it's become a dessert spice in parts of Europe, an ingredient in \"pumpkin pie\" spice-mixes. In Sweden, allspice is associated with pork and veal; it's an essential spice in Swedish meatballs. Commercial sausage-makers in Scandinavia and Germany normally use lots of allspice in their higher-quality sausages.You can pound the berries easily enough in a mortar, but the simplest thing is to have a plain 'dedicated' pepper-grinder filled with allspice berries near your stove.

Also the chocolate peanut protein ones are good too)  All i can say is \"ACK!!!!!!\"  I hate that it looks like i am reccommending these nasty peanut butter ones because i am NOT. i hate them. the box i received sucked.  I've never eaten something with so much peanut in it that had so little flavor.  It's like they used a magic machine to suck the flavor out of the peanuts.  I did eat half the box over the course of a few weeks, thinking that maybe they would grow on me.  But after just finishing another one i think i can say with certainty that the only thing growing is a cavity on my back molar.  (they are not tasty but they certainly are chewy.)  In my opinion they are not worth rotting your teeth out of your head for. and what a complete waste of calories too! I feel like i should go jogging again today.

I realize that not all tastes and/or ingredients one might like independently would necessarily taste great together, but I knew that the combination of these 3 ingredients could 'make magic happen'. :)An ingredient profile is a great start, and includes the fact that for this product, the '3 stars of our show' :) were not accompanied by crap (which is very important to me, especially given 'how' I intended to use this product), but the nutrition profile would 'make or break' whether, and if so how much, I might end up eating these granola bars.The most surprising things (and positively so) about this product's nutrition profile, in my opinion, are as follows --* Each bar is only 130 calories (and while that might be 'too' low for anyone intending to use this product as a meal replacement, one could eat two of them and still be below what so many other snack bars and 'healthy snacks' come in at, calorie-wise) (besides, one can always eat more of something that is low in calories, versus more readily 'cutting back' on something that is high in calories [and especially if the higher calorie item does not involve much volume, or an otherwise satisfyingly 'full' feeling after eating a 'cut back' version of such]).* Calories are one thing, but it's the breakdown of what those calories are comprised of, that makes 'the' difference, for me -- and each of these granola bars has 6g of protein, 4g of fiber (3g of which are insoluble), 1.5g of monounsaturated fat, only 0.5g of saturated fat, only 90mg of sodium, and what positively stunned me was that each bar has only 6g of sugar -- THAT is remarkable, and is of benefit not only in and of itself, but is so important to those who must pay special attention to their blood sugar, including those who contend with insulin resistance.Ingredients and nutrition are important, but taste ends up being a kind of 'trump card' -- and, thankfully, these taste good!They have a texture that is kind of 'in between' that of a thicker-textured 'rice cake' (sort of), and a rice krispie treat (albeit with noticeably less of the 'tack-like' aspect found with [marshmallow 'glue' -rendered] rice krispie treats).These granola bars don't 'feel' 'heavy' in the stomach (and yet can satisfy hunger) -- and what this 'lighter in the stomach' aspect allows for, importantly, for my needs, is that these are one of the only 'foods' that I can eat during a workout (sometimes, if I haven't eaten enough before a workout, or otherwise 'push' past what I'd originally intended, activity-wise, and find that I need a few more calories, these fit the bill [and sometimes it's just a bite or two, taken while mid-workout, but given the nutrient profile, it makes a difference (and keeps me from getting lightheaded, or otherwise not having enough energy to engage in physical activity)]).This product has now replaced what previously used to be the only granola bar I would eat (Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey Granola Bars). Additionally, a 'bonus', when compared to the Nature Valley granola bars, is that these Kashi bars don't 'crumble' -- not only when eating them, but also with respect to their 'survivability' when in a purse or gym bag -- the Kashi bars stay intact (whereas the Nature Valley granola bars would tend to get broken, and/or crumble [and could make for an annoying mess]).I now keep a few of these with me practically at all times, and eat them while 'on the go', when running errands, or when running late and needing something to 'bridge the gap' until my next meal.All in all, I am so glad that the folks at Kashi came out with this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "'Just right' in several respects, and one of the only foods I can eat during a workout", "unixReviewTime": 1360540800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013"}

If you're hankering for a Snicker candy bar, these might not satisfy you. However, if you want a crunchy, nutty, dark chocolate treat that makes you feel good after eating, you may want to try these.  They are low in sugar--only 6 gms--about the same as in a cup of Cheerios or Total.  The nutritionist said to think of sugar as poison--your body wants to eliminate sugar before fat, so stay low in sugar. I keep one of these bars in my purse when I'm out doing errands in case I get hungry.  I love the dark chocolate chips and nutty crunch. One bar at 130 calories is quite satisfying and is a great go-to treat when you want a little sweetness in your day.One bar is only 3 points on Weight Watcher's point system.

Maybe it was the picture on the front of the box, with the bar showing lots of chocolate and almonds and the little circle saying No High Fructose corn syrup.  Whatever it was, it worked, I bought a box.And the taste wasn't too bad.  Even for not being a coffee fan I thought that this bar had a good mix of flavors.  You could definitely taste the chocolate and the coffee flavor was tolerable.  I don't drink regular mochas so I can't compare the taste there, but it seems reasonable to me to think it would be similar.  The almonds, even though I could see them in the bar didn't have much of a taste though.  I think they were a bit over-powered by everything else.  And the oats were just texture and filler rather than being a large part of the taste.  They are chewy bars, like the box advertises, but not so chewy that it is hard to get through them.  I'd say they are on par with regular granola bars and the texture that is portable yet easy to get through.Kashi has pretty decent ingredients.  This of course has their blend of different grains, almonds, corn flour, honey and some other things.  They used the honey and brown rice syrup as a sweetener with the chocolate, and there is some coffee extract included for that mocha flavor.  Altogether it makes a bar around 130 calories, which really isn't that bad compared to a lot of granola bars out there.  Protein is 6 grams and the fat content is 3.5 grams.  There aren't many vitamins to speak of, but it does have fiber and a little bit of iron.  Sugars weighed in at 6 grams, which also isn't too bad compared to a lot of other bars.It did its job and filled me up for breakfast for a few hours.  I'd have to say that after experiencing the whole box, I do want lunch a little earlier, but not much.  Perhaps pairing it with a piece of fruit would make a more filling breakfast, but as a snack this could stand just fine on its own.  I'll probably keep trying out the different flavors of these bars, and will eventually come back to this one.Review by M.

Of those however, the almond is (to me) by far the best.They all have a chewiness that's not like caramel chewiness, but rather a slightly-stale-Rice-Crispies chewiness.

It definitely had the crunch as well from the different grains the bar was made up of.  And I liked the crunch, it really made it feel like you were biting into something substantial.The ingredients are good in this bar.  Not the best out of all the brands out there, but still reasonably decent.  The main sweetener is Brown Rice Syrup, but there is also crystalline fructose and evaporated can juice crystals.  The grains are the Kashi seven grain blend that they like to advertise and there's wheat bran and a few other things included as well.  There are some hard to pronounce ingredients, but these appear to be the vitamins.This bar has 160 calories in it.  Not as much as some but still not enough to justify eating these as a snack.  Use them for when you're exercising, or don't have enough time for a full breakfast.  There is 5 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein as well.  Although there are 13 grams of sugar, which seems a little high.  I do have to say that eating one of these bars does not make me as full as other bars do.

Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.Also, there are some pretty good pods out there, and they are not expensive.

And when it do find it, the price is astronomical.  Buying from Amazon is a great solution for me.My rye bread recipe only calls for two cups of rye flour for five loaves, so it takes me a little while to go through a bag of rye, but I pour these bags into a plastic storage container like I do with all my other flours and grains.  That keeps the critters out of them and keeps the flour from getting too hot and rancid.I probably won't need any more rye flour until later this year, but when I do, I'll be glad to buy another six-pack from Amazon.Oh, and what about the product itself?  This rye flour is so incredibly delicious!  The flavor is really great and not overpowering.Recipe:6.5 cups warm water3.5 tablespoons yeast (heaping)3 tablespoons salt (level)3 tablespoons caraway seed (heaping) - plus a few generous pinches on top of the loaves at baking2 cups rye flour10 cups unbleached white flour (level)Mix the ingredients and let the dough sit overnight in the fridge in a 12qt plastic tub with a loose lid.

Thanks to Amazon I now have a wild yeast pure rye, as well as one started with a pinch of my wheat starter,  It says something about the freshness and quality that the starter was foaming after one day!  I have already made rye bread using a culture started from this flour, and no yeast was necessary :)Beyond that, I like that it is packed in small bags, as I have to store it in the freezer to combat the tropical humidity and pests.  I also like that it is 100% rye, not a mixture like so many others.Thank you Amazon :)  Without this service I would have the trappings of western civilization largely off limits but for when I travel.  i really appreciate having access to the foods I grew up with, and ingredients I need to cook what I like.... which is pretty much the only way to get those things here.

The cheese serves as a perfect counterpoint to the spicy spinach. Going against tradition I sometimes add a small amount of cooked brown rice, but I prefer the dish undiluted. And, I found the cheese chunks plentiful.The ingredients -- spinach, water, tomatoes, paneer cheese, onions, sunflower oil, salt, garlic, cornstarch, chilies, cumin are startling in their simplicity.

Grossman", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I've tried many, though not all, of the Tasty Bite line of \"1 Step - 1 minute\" of products. This Madras Lentils ranks among the best. I think the spices are just right, with on major exception, detailed below, that applies to all their products that I've tried, the consistency is near perfect as the lentils are \"al dente\" (cooked to near perfection) IMHO. As with the entires Tasty Bite line up these are ideal for travel, quick lunches at work or home when you just don't have the time nor desire to spend preparing something. At current prices, they're a terrific value at less than $3 for a \"two serving\" package. Honestly though, unless you're on a near starvation diet, or half a package is being served as a very small side dish to a larger plate of food, I think most people will consume the entire package. I tend to, though I'm cutting back foe health purposes, and the whole package constitutes a full and with one major exception healthy meal; the exception being sodium.. If one is on a weight loss plan that focuses on high protein this is a near ideal product. The nutrition facts for the entire package are as follows:300 calories; 100 from fat . Broken down into detail and percentage IOC the recommended Daily Allowance based upon a 2,000 to 2,500 calories (not a weight loss level for mist people) per day diet, these are marked by the % sign in the details that follow:1. Total Fat 12 grams (18%), 5 grams of which are Saturated Fat (26%), 0 grams of which are Tran Fat2. Cholesterol is 20 mg (6%)3. Sodium: 1,020 mg or 42% of the RDA.  THIS IS EXTREMELY HIGH. Accordingly, if you've got a heart condition or are on a sodium restricted diet, or just don't want all that sodium in one meal then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!4. Total Carbohydrates = 36 grams which = 12%. Of that, Dietary Fiber represents 10 grams (40%); a good thing for most people,while Sugars are a negligible 4 grams.5. You'll get 14 grams of Protein which will help you remain satiated for a good while.6. Finally, the vitamins and minerals content are:Vitamin A - 12%;Vitamin C - 8%;Calcium - 8% and;Iron - a handsome 28%.REMEMBER, THE ABOVE VALUES ARE FOR THE ENTIRE PACKAGE, WHICH IS TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED TWO SERVINGS. I feel this is a better representation to go by because based upon the percentage of reviews that address the portion size at the time of this review, most people I believe consume the entire package at or for one meal.In summary, with the exception of the sodium, this is a relatively healthy product, and one that is well-suited for a lot of weight loss programs. The sodium should not be taken lightly though. It's widely believed that Americans have much to much salt in their diets and if you read the nutritional value of the plethora of products consumed and add to that the amount of table salt people add to their food, you'll understand why I reach this conclusion.Without the sodium though, this us a \"near perfect\" product from a dietary health perspective. It's the sodium content that causes me to give this three stars instead of five. It's too bad that Tasty Bite didn't play around with adding some other herbs and spices that would have allowed them to reduce the sodium and still end up with a palatable and desirable food item.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Tasty but BUYER BEWARE OF SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE", "unixReviewTime": 1404518400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2014"}

I had been having major digestive issues for about 3 months, so I went online to do some research and found a site that outlined a diet which consisted of consuming gelatin with every meal.  There was no explanation as to why, so I did further research and discovered that gelatin is great for healing the gut!  Not only did it aid in digestion, but another exciting fact was that gelatin heals \"leaky gut syndrome,\" which causes various food intolerances.  I have had intolerance to many common foods...especially eggs, which I love.As I continued my research, I saw that Great Lakes was recommended over the grocery store brands for its high quality of being hormone and antibiotic-free.  I could not find any locally, so in desperation of needing relief from my stomach troubles, I decided to get some immediately...I did not care what brand, until I could get my order placed on Amazon.So, I began Knox gelatin last Thursday evening.  I made some grape juice jello and I felt immediate relief in my stomach after eating it.  Very soothing.  So, I continued for the next few days.  I noticed that I felt tired every time after eating it.  I did sleep better.  By Sunday, I saw that the skin on my face was looking scaly.  The cysts in my breasts were becoming tender again...which, BTW, is a sign that I have ingested estrogen!  Hormones!!  Not good!!!I had placed my order on Amazon on Saturday, after deciding which form to buy.  I decided to order one of each, the green and the orange...both bovine...to see which one I would like to take.  I naturally love jello...so making jello was the fun and natural thing for me to do!My order arrived on Monday!!!  Wow!!  Very fast!!  So, I immediately flushed all of the remaining Knox jello down the drain and started on the Great Lakes!  I made some jello and also used the green can in my smoothies...the collagen hydrolysate.  I ate less jello due to using the green can as well.  Tuesday, I woke up feeling like my muscles had been pumped up ever so slightly....it's hard to explain, but I felt like I had a protective barrier over the surface of my body...and I felt refreshed!  Yes...I am VERY senstive to my body!  I slept very well and I did not feel tired upon awakening, like I did on the Knox brand.  Day 2...Wednesday....I woke up with a groggy headache, although I still had that body protected sensation.  Day 3 again, a headache.  I rarely ever get headaches.I would say that I took less than the 2 TBSP per day.  I don't know if I took too much for me...I am only 100 lbs. and was detoxing too quickly....thus the headache, or it does not agree with me.  So, for now, I have stopped taking the green can and am enjoying just the jello...Love it, with grape juice and black cherry juice concentrate.  I feel stronger already.  I noticed today, that the skin on my face looks slightly more glowy and dewey....hmmm....very fast results!AND BTW....the breast tenderness went away after a couple of days of taking the GL brand.  So, in addressing this person, who goes by \"it's\" I cannot believe that GL has hormones and antibiotics in it because my breasts are a great barometer in this regard.  We eat mostly organic foods and we eat no meat with any hormones or antibiotics so my body has stayed clean in this vein for many years, so I can tell when my hormones are disturbed.So, I feel quite confident of this product and feel very good about using it.  I do smell an odor when I pour the hot water to mix.  It is not very pleasant...kind of like animal hide...but once it is mixed and congeals, I do not taste what I smelled.  I tried mixing the green can with water one night and it had that same smell and taste to it, which I found unbearable...but I have been tested to be a super-taster (meaning I have high sense of taste).  So, when I did take it, I put it in my smoothies and I could not taste it at all.  I really loved cutting cubes of the jello and mixing it in my smoothies...soooo yummy!!!  A real dessert-like treat!!!My husband does not like jello, so he is using the green can daily in his tea.  He, who has been prone to frequent headaches...very severe at times, has had no problems with the green can...so, go figure!Too early to tell about joint issues, etc., but I highly recommend this brand over any other.  I will report back when more time has passed to give more results.  I can't wait to be able to eat more foods from my gut being healed!!Update: 4/12/14So, I have been taking gelatin for 2.5 weeks now.  I can't believe the changes!!!  My facial skin is plumper, so i look younger!  My hair has body so it's fluffier, so that I don't have to wash it as often as before when it went flat the next day after a shampoo.  My skin feels sooooooooo soft!!  And I do feel stronger!  Previously, I was not able to do push-ups on my palms...had to do them with my fists.  I just happened to try one, and my wrists felt stronger!!!  No pain when doing them!  I actually did not have much joint pain to speak of, so I guess I don't notice any changes in that department.  But, I surely to recommend this product, as it is certainly youthifying!!!I can't wait to see how I look and feel a month down the road, or even a year from now!!!  My youth is certainly being renewed like the eagle's!!  I must add, that I have been eating more brothy foods as well, since discovering that we need to be eating the whole animal for best nutritional balance, so it could also be adding to the mix, but on days when we just don't feel like soups...we can feel confident that we are getting what we need by eating gelatin in the form of jello with all our meals!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Like night and day from the grocery store brand!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1396742400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2014"}

I am extremely pleased with it as well.  The only difference between the beef and porcine versions that I could detect was that I can taste the beef version slightly when I add it to my coffee.  With the porcine gelatin I can't really tell it's there.I first decided to try gelatin as a supplement because I'd heard it helps you sleep better. I started with a few boxes of Knox Unflavored gelatin from the grocery store, and although I didn't sleep any better, my joint pain improved remarkably! After reading other reviews of this product, I ordered a container of the porcine gelatin and gave it a try. I put a tablespoon in the bottom of my (large) coffee mug, poured in the coffee and all the fixin's, and stirred it well. The product dissolved easily and was virtually undetectable in the coffee. Since I started taking gelatin I find that I am bounding out of the bed the way I did when I was in my 30's, instead of crawling out and supporting my weight with my hands on my knees until I can straighten my back and get my legs in gear. This product dissolves better than the Knox did and I find the container easy to use and measure from.I am so pleased with the results that I have been making gelatin doggie treats for my senior Jack Russells. I heat a cup and a half of chicken broth (reduced sodium) in the microwave and stir in 4 teaspoons of gelatin. When the mixture cools a little I pour it into a plastic ice cube tray and stick it in the fridge.  Each morning and evening I split one of the cubes and gave half to each little monster, and they gobble it up.  Before that I was stirring a half-teaspoon into a quarter cup room-temperature chicken broth and letting them drink it, and they gobbled that up too. And now, darned if they don't seem to be moving a little better also. (What am I thinking!?? It took fourteen years for them to slow down, and here I go starting them up again. Sigh.)In short, I find that both the porcine and beef versions of this product are easy to use.  They both dissolve easily, and I can definitely tell when I've skipped it for a day or two.  I'll be ordering the porcine version in the future only because I can slightly taste the beef in my coffee, but let's be clear: I am putting a TABLESPOON of gelatin into a CUP of coffee.  I find it amazing that the taste is so slight, and even more amazing that the porcine version has almost no taste at all.  I'll continue with the beef if the porcine version becomes unavailable or a price difference develops.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product; slightly more taste than the non-kosher variety.", "unixReviewTime": 1387929600, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2013"}

When the pain is at its worst, it can be excruciating, and can be difficult even to stand up.I went in for some X-rays a few months ago and was told that source of the problem was that the cartilage in my spine had worn away, leaving the bones grinding on each other.  Ouch.I tried various products including MSM and bone/cartilage strengthening supplements.  Most didn't seem to do much.  Then on impulse I decided to try gelatin. Some gelatins are full of toxic junk, so I searched online for a higher quality product. I ended up ordering Great Lakes kosher beef gelatin.I'm relieved to say that it does seem to be helping.  The first time I tried it, I had had several days of intense pain. Within a few hours of taking this gelatin, the pain was gone and I was able to move more freely.I found that the recommended dosage (a tablespoon in a cup of hot water) did not have much of an effect. Instead I take about 1/4 cup, dissolved in two cups of hot water.  It's thick and syrupy, and works much better for me.  I don't need to take it every day, but take it when my back pain starts flaring up and it always seems to help.What I like about this product:- It tastes fine. (Not good, not bad... just a bland nondescriptive taste.  But not like some bad tasting gelatins I've read about.)- Every time I take it, it seems to improve my back pain.What I don't like about it:- Dissolving it in water can take some work.  Cold water doesn't work at all; it gels almost instantly.  Trying to dissolve it in boiling water, poured boiling from a tea kettle, is also problematic, as it seems to \"cook\" into strands and not dissolve completely.  The best solution I've found is to put some gelatin in a coffee up, boil a kettle of water, leave it sitting for ten minutes or so, then add it to the gelatin stirring constantly.ADDENDUM:It's not just my back pain that has been helped by this gelatin.  When my back locks up, I can hardly bend over, much less touch my toes.  When I take this gelatin I can bend at the waist and touch my toes with no problem. It's not a miracle cure, and I don't know if it would help everyone, but it definitely helps me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This gelatin has helped with my lower back pain and flexibility.", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}

First of all, I knew when buying that them these \"truffles\" are not the same kinds of creations that are named truffles by chocolate stores and other chocolate brands.

Plain old chocolate, not the bad-quality kind (like Hersheys), but not the good kind either. I also prefer the types of truffles with a shell and a ganache or other conventional truffle filling inside. And for ~$20, IMO this box of truffles is a bit overpriced and more of a quantity over quality item. This is coming from someone who has tried a LOT of chocolate, some gourmet/small-batch, some mass-produced, and others in the middle (like Godiva). I believe similar, if not identically branded, truffles can also be found in some warehouse stores like Sam's Club, likely at a lower price.In short, I would say that these truffles are probably a bit overrated and at least here on this site, overpriced.

That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etcWhy 2 stars? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar. If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They cost little more than the smaller sizes.I'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer any of these:a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! No vinegar.b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar.c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend.d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.If you like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of these other hot saucesUPDATE (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen which is a TV program on PBS recently rated hot sauces.

Betty Crocker pasta meals are awesome for making those odds and ends disappear.

The Stroganoff is one of my favorites, partly because I like Stroganoff but also because it's an easy way to get rid of the last of the sour cream.

I find it difficult to describe, because it is definitely chocolatey, and sweet, but yet it's not quite like eating candy or cookies etc.  It will handle multiple types of snacking cravings whether you want chocolate, candy, sweet in general, crunchy, crispy, or sweet-salty etc.One thing that surprised me was that all of the pieces in the mix, except the candy drops, are basically sized to match the Chex squares, so they are smaller than I had anticipated.  This is a big plus for me, as I find most \"bite-sized\" products to be more like \"3-bite-sized\", and this mix is actually really bite-sized.  This makes it easy to eat and it also is very charming.  I think it would be a good option for children, to whom you could give a small amount in their lunch/bento box or as a snack, and they will feel they are getting a treat without eating too much junk.The mix contains adorable, crispy, and tasty tiny chocolate-coated pretzels.  There are mini chocolate cookies, uncoated and unfilled, which resemble the outer cookie of an Oreo.  The mix contains some M&M; like chocolate candies.  It also contains two different types of Chex pieces.  One is lightly coated in a nice cocoa flavor, the other with a bit thicker, sweeter vanilla coating.  There are comparatively few of the vanilla Chex pieces; they serve just to add counterpoint to the chocolate.This mix is labelled \"dark chocolate\" but it isn't too strong or bitter.  Everything is fresh, crispy/crunchy etc. as it should be.  The flavor intensities of the different types of pieces keeps the mix from coming off like a variant of bridge mix.

This is more of a Cajun blend than merely a hot blend. A review of the ingredients do not reveal any cayenne pepper, Tabasco or other famous Cajun flavorings, but that is the impression I get. I can almost taste crab oil on the back of my throat, but it is not listed in the ingredients. I guess it could be a psychosomatic reaction.I was hoping/expecting flavoring akin to Flamin' Hot - but I cannot tell you if I was exactly disappointed as I was surprised by the Scoville meter in my mouth that was screaming for the fire extinguisher.

If I'd been given this in a blind taste-test, I'm unsure I would have even identified it as supposing to be a cheese-flavored product.  It's really, really bland.There's nothing inherently wrong with \"bland\" if that's what you are after.  Bland obviously is want one wants for a base for other things, for example.  But the marketing on this product seems deceptive to me.  It is sold as a \"meal in a bowl\" (suggesting it's not just a base, but a fully seasoned dish).  I specifically ordered it because I was looking for a quick way to make some basic cheesy pasta, and the product (and reviews) suggest that this is meant to be a cheese flavored item.  If it was marketed as \"pasta in a mild, light sauce with a hint of cheese flavor\", then I wouldn't have ordered it, because that wasn't what I was looking for.  I can see that someone might be looking for something like that; but in any event, that's not the implication from the packaging.I don't like dissing this product because it sounds like a number of people find it convenient, like the flavor, and want to be able to keep ordering it.  So I would say, as long as you understand that this a very gently flavored item, of predictably low quality pasta, and that will suit your purposes, great.

Only on rare occasions - with certain flavors - is Amazon less expensive, as in the case of these butter noodles at $0.84 each through the Subscribe and Save program.The biggest selling point of these pasta or rice side dishes for me remains their great convenience.

Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity.

Quite frankly, one pouch is perfect for a larger individual meal with maybe a sandwich or a piece of fish or a small steak or even as a quick side to a fast food burger (anything is better than french fries sitting in the warmer for too long...)Note it does NOT take 8 Minutes to prepare - I set the water kettle or coffee pot to make hot water, dump the pouch into a bowl, add a pad of butter (preferably real!), toss in a dash of pepper, pour the now ready hot water into the bowl, fluff with a fork and let sit while I'm pouring my drink and gathering up the main item to set on the table (usually next to the laptop, who has time NOT to work - or surf the 'net - in these situations?!)So in a pinch, such as while on a disaster deployment living in a travel trailer or in a hotel room with just a coffee pot (hot water), these packets are GREAT!!!

For larger families, I'd opt for cooking two bags.They store well. Unlike real potatoes, that begin to sprout pretty rapidly, these potatoes can last up to a year when stored properly. I love that I can buy them in bulk and spare myself a run to the grocery store. They're a great thing to keep on the shelves for a busy day's dinner.They come individually packaged.

I open the bag, use everything inside, and don't have to worry about finding a way to close it and store it away later on.I love these. For the price, I find them to be worth it.

Erythritol is natural occurring sugar alcohol. It can be found in small amounts in plant foods such as: grapes, melons, etc. I find it great, because it doesn't cause me stomach issues like other sugar-free sweeteners. It doesn't have an impact on blood sugar, or cause tooth decay either. I use it on its own in recipes, drinks, etc.I also mix it with stevia extract to make my own &#34;Truvia&#34; out of it, because it is less expensive to do so. I basically mix one cup of Now Foods Erythritol and 2 teaspoons Now Foods Better Stevia Extract on low a blender. A 2.5 lb. package erythritol will yeild 6 plus cups of &#34;Truvia&#34; for just over $20.00. I think it tastes better and I get more bang for my buck with my erythritol, since it is more expensive than sugar and only 70% as sweet.Here are the pros and cons from my standpoint:Pros:1. Very low calorie - almost no calories.2. Natural - it usually derived from fruit.3. Less likely to cause gastro distress than other sugar substitutes.4. Doesn't impact blood sugar.5. Doesn't promote tooth decay.6. Can be mixed with stevia to make &#34;Truvia.&#34;7. Erythritol on its own tastes very similar to sugar with no after taste.Cons:1. More expensive than sugar.2. 70% as sweet as sugar.3. Doesn't dissolve as fast and as easily as sugar.4. Has cooling sensation if eaten directly out of the bag. This doesn't matter if it is used in or with other foods.5.

He was really suffering.I made him the throat coat and the cold remedy versions, heavily laced with honey so it was palatable and put them in his Oxo Travel Mugs.They really reduced his suffering and made his long days a little less tedious.Throat Coat is by far the best product. Be sure to steep it quite a while as recommended. The name says it all. You'll feel as if your throat is lined with velvet.And there are no chemicals or drugs to interfere with the ability to drive or even think (antihistamines make me a whirling dervish & make the hubby pass out cold).I sent a box of this over to my sister in law when she came down with a bug and she raved about it for weeks.6 of them is a lot, but if you have a lot of family and especially kids who tend to get colds a lot, you'll use them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hard to find product, excellent herbal remedies", "unixReviewTime": 1206489600, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2008"}

Even their Mother's Milk tea has that warning and it is made specifically to help women increase their breast milk supply while breastfeeding. With that said...I am breastfeeding and have been for a long time. Before I found these teas I would suffer through a sore throat, stuffy nose, cold, etc with out taking medication because I didn't want my baby/toddler to get any through my breast milk. Herbal remedies are much gentler on your body so I feel very comfortable knowing that these herbs will be passed to my child instead of a strong chemical remedy like DayQuil. I make my teas very strong and add some local raw honey for even more health benefits, and it makes the teas taste even better. I do enjoy the taste of the teas much more than I thought I would since they are after all medical remedies. The teas are not miracle cures but they really do help and you don't get a doped up feeling like you do from a lot of the OTC meds out there. I'm not sure I have a favorite, I find they are all really nice to have on hand when you need them. I also enjoy just drinking them, mainly the Cold Care and Echinacea, as a nice cup of tea on a cold day.Buy one box and see what you think, I don't think you'll be disappointed.***EDIT***I just wanted to add that while in general herbs are pretty safe when breastfeeding you do not want to take them as supplements or eat/drink extremely large amounts of them with out first making sure they are safe. You would probably have to drink an entire box of this stuff in one day for it to really cause any problems with breastfeeding so if you drink the typical 1-6 cups (using 1 tea bag per cup, 6 cups steeped with 2 tea bags each might be a little much) you should be fine.***EDIT***Just found out from my midwife that although these teas are safe to drink while breastfeeding they are not safe to drink while pregnant, except for the Echinacea which is safe to drink while pregnant.

The tea relies on the herbs fennel, aniseed, and coriander, believed to increase milk production. I like that Traditional Medicinals uses organic, vegan, non-GMO, pharmacopoeial-grade herbs (at least in the organic version of the tea, which is the only one that I have seen sold for some time now).To use the tea properly, it needs to be steeped, which can be a minor inconvenience, but necessary to get the full effect. The teabag should be added to 8 oz. of boiled water and steeped covered for 10 minutes. If you plan to drink a lot of medicinal teas like this, it's probably worth investing in a teacup with a cover - otherwise, covering the cup with a flat coaster, plate or saucer works just fine. Once uncovered, it will probably take between 5 and 20 minutes before it's cool enough to drink.I think the tea is really delicious, with the caveat, that in order to enjoy it, you must like the flavor of black licorice due to the aniseed. If you don't *like* licorice, you need to at least be able to tolerate it, or you'll never get this tea down! I drink it with nothing added, but it could also be lightly sweetened with some honey or agave nectar if it's too bitter for you.So the big question is...does it work? As with anything medicinal or herbal, in the western or eastern tradition, some things will work for some and not for others. I can tell you that I personally do see a direct effect from this tea. At the beginning, I would drink a cup and quickly notice the increase. As nursing has gone on, the effect is more subtle, but definitely noticeable. I drink one cup a night simply because I believe this is a healthy herbal preparation to support milk supply, and it supports my supply through night nursing. I usually increase that to two a day while menstruating, because my supply drops slightly during that time. When my baby is sick or going through some other increased nursing period, or if I cave in to an illness and take a decongestant, I will increase it to three or more.If you are having (or think you might be having) true milk supply issues, though, this tea alone will probably not have enough of an effect to correct the problem.Amazon's subscribe and save program offers as good a price as I have seen on it anywhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good tasting, and generally effective", "unixReviewTime": 1212624000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2008"}

The concoction has helped me resist serious sneezing allergies and I get less colds and they're less severe than usual as well as help me with my anxiety.However, because the kava kava is very strong and potent (and too much can toxify the liver), I only add it to my concoction a couple of times a week.  Rooibos is a lot less strong and doesn't get my mind as cloudy as adding the kava kava.Note: if you have any loose herbs, muslin bags such asCotton Muslin Bags 4x6 Inches 25 Count Packare great to pack them in wihout having to deal with trying to remove loose herbs in your teas.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "TASTY and a truly calming to my nerves!!", "unixReviewTime": 1353369600, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2012"}

Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the \"universal medicine.\"  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy.\"There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor.

Maybe, but the good part is that I'm not relying on meds. Only time will tell, but for those in doubt, this is a tea very well worth the investment if you are looking for a natural remedy of sorts.The taste and aroma is best described as nutty, kind of like roasted peanut brittle with hints of tahini or sesame.

I was thrilled with how well it worked and how quickly.  Always happy to find a natural alternative to drugstore potions whenever possible, so yay! and buh-bye, nasty pink liquid and gross, hard-to-choke-down chalky tablets.  Personally, I love the slightly lemony, peppery 'bite' of ginger so that's a bonus as well.The problem with the fresh ginger is that it's not something I use every day and therefore a lot goes to waste and I've found that the quality of the roots available in local stores can vary a great deal from store to store and from one shopping trip to the next and - unfortunately - I can't always tell the good from the bad and the ugly until AFTER I've gotten it home and peeled, minced, and even sometimes tasted. The time/labor element of peeling, mincing and simmering for 15 minutes and the subsequent clean up of cookware and utensils is also something nice to avoid when not feeling well.Having been happy with other varieties of Traditional Medicinals tea in the past, I picked up a box of this at the store fully expecting it to be much inferior to the fresh but was very pleasantly surprised to find that not the case at all.  I love this tea!  Brewed covered for 13-15 minutes in a pre-warmed mug, it comes out still warm.  Not exactly the same peppery intensity of the fresh and sadly lacking any real hint of lemon, it's still very good-tasting in its own right.  Plus, it's always handy, don't have to worry about spoilage and it's portable.  It also works very, very quickly to relieve the occasional nausea and to aid digestion when I've overeaten or eaten something a little too greasy/spicy for me.  It also seems to work well in heading off potential problems when consumed shortly before a meal.

The licorice flavor is strong, and it's not a flavor I'm normally fond of when I find it in tea.  But it's not as bad here as in other teas I've had.  I can taste a hint of spice (clove, cardamom, cinnamon) and that may be improving the flavor for me.  I'm not familiar with all of the other ingredients, but I don't notice any odd or unrecognizable flavors, so I guess the overall blend works well (if you can stand the licorice).The licorice root likely does have some effect on the liver.  Please see the comments below for a link to a web page from the National Institutes of Health regarding the safety of licorice.  Probably in small amounts and/or for only a few weeks at a time, this ingredient will not cause problems.  However, if you have hypertension or are pregnant, you will want to avoid this tea.  It also may interfere with the action of some prescription drugs (many of which are processed by the liver).My main criticism is that there isn't any documented medical or scientific need to do any kind of detox.  Please see the comments below for a link from the Mayo Clinic about detox diets.  Your liver and kidneys are already optimized for removing dangerous substances from the body and if you think your liver or kidneys are not functioning optimally, it's probably best to consult a medical doctor.  Additionally, because this is a tea, the amounts of the active ingredients may vary from cup to cup, depending on the temperature of the water, how many bags you brew at once, and how long you steep the tea.  So you may be getting different amounts of the ingredients at different times.In the end, whether or not to consume this tea is up to you.  If this is something you're interested in, I encourage you to investigate the ingredients further.  Personally, I don't believe detox is necessary and will probably not drink this tea frequently, for that reason.  Also, I am not a fan of licorice in tea, although, as I said earlier, this is one of the more tolerable licorice-containing teas I've tried.  2.5 stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "mixed feelings about this one", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}

Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement.\"There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.Kombucha tea is my second favorite Yogi green tea. The flavors added are natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The flavors are mild and pleasant however and this tea has the added health benefits of Kombucha but so does the Rejuvenation tea, which has this same ingredient in it.Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Amazon. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long.The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas.

It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities.\"Yogi Tea's use of \"Kombucha-Pure\", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!Highly recommended.*****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!", "unixReviewTime": 1181692800, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2007"}

But I wanted something a bit sweeter and lighter to drink in the evening, including before bed and on occasion as an after dinner beverage, so I decided to try Yogi Tea Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut Tea. The first four ingredients of Roastaroma are roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, and cinnamon, and it is the chicory that gives Roastaroma it's coffee-like full-bodiedness, as chicory is often used as a coffee substitute. Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut does not have barley in it, but its first three ingredients are roasted chicory root, carob pod, and organic cinnamon bark, and I assume this accounts for why I consider it to be in a similar herbal tea category as Roastaroma. Some of the sweetness of Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut comes from stevia leaf. I'm drinking a cup now, sweetened with half a packet ofTruvia Natural Sweetenerand cooled with a dash of fat-free milk. Sometimes I sweeten it with a little raw sugar. And I find it delicious and satisfying, with a nice, mildly spicy aftertaste that I assume comes from the organic black pepper, clove bud, and organic ginger root that are among the ingredients of this fine tea.Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut also contains organic cardamom seed, and thus this tea contains the five traditional Ayurvedic spices, cardamom seed, cinnamon bark, clove bud, ginger root and black pepper, which were among the ingredients in the prototype \"Yogi Tea\" that Yogi Bhajan shared with his students after he arrived in America in 1969. (It wasn't until 1984 when the Yogi Tea Company that brings us Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut and other fine teas was formed.) One can get a sense of the care with which Yogi Teas are made by visiting their website and/or YouTube and watching the video of Yogi Tea's herbalist, Guru Hari Khalsa, explaining the Yogi Tea philosophy.I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of Tahitian Vanilla Hazenut tea bags through Amazon's easy to manage Subscribe & Save program on 9/25/11, and each box arrived with a \"best by\" date of June 2013 on it, which is a good long time from the time of purchase. (16 bags per box x 6 boxes = 96 cups of tea, a little over a 3-month supply for someone who drinks one cup a day.)

It is stronger that way, and more intense of an experience, although it still tastes great with just one bag. I'd been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this tea.Woman's Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and is organic.The ingredients in Woman's Dong Quai Tonic are: dong quai root extract, juniper berry extract, and a proprietary blend of herbs, including all organic: cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, chamomile flower, dandelion root, anise seed, stinging nettle leaf, dong quai root (I guess as opposed to the extract), black pepper, and orange oil. Amazingly, I can taste some of these, like the chamomile, and the anise seed and the ginger, making for a lovely and complex cup of tea. I'm impressed!Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Organic Woman's Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue, restore your energy and balance a woman's hormones. This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as \"blood deficiency,\" resulting from stress, poor digestion, or improper eating and health habits. We've included in our tonic the potent \"Queen of Herbs\" Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis), shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs, addressing common female hormone imbalances, helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building all-around health. Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine (1995) indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions, including minor symptoms of PMS (such as mild mood changes) and menopause (such as hot flashes). This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body, as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance. According to yogic wisdom, women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers. A woman can choose to be balanced, happy and healthy. Choose to drink a daily cup of Woman's Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy, beautiful, graceful self.\" I don't know about that, but I do like the tea, and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes (I've been having fewer...whether or not it's due to the tea, I don't know!), which is why I bought it---for menopausal support.There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Highly recommended.*****", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive Cup of Tea, Could Be Helpful with Women's Health Issues", "unixReviewTime": 1159920000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2006"}

I take food coloring and make different colors (pink, purple, red, green, and blue) and let me kiddies dip their vegetables in it. They love making rainbow food- and I love that they're eatng healthy. I also mix some dyes in for salads. They get to pick which color they want their salad to be.

While it was decent, I have since had better and will probably not be ordering it again.For one, it is impossible to tell the age of the teas in the tins. For Pu-erh, that's not such a big deal, but for green teas and the Jasmine, you want normally want to get a batch that is a fresh as possible. PierMall is a big reseller of products from around the world, and there is no telling how long what you get had been sitting in some huge warehouse, slowly losing flavor. Another consideration is that you get a random sampling of Chinese teas, no the specific types that is implied by their Amazon listing. If you visit their website, you will see that they draw from this selection:* China Black Tea* Tiekuanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)* Oolong* Lung Ching DragonWell Green Tea* Yunnan Pu-erh* Jasmine Tea* White Tea* PuErh Tea with Chrysanthmum* Lychee Black Tea* Rose Black Tea* Rose Green Tea* Osthsmum Green TeaI don't know about you, but I'd like a little more certainty when buying a product. If you are new to tea and trying different varieties out, or are getting this as a gift, then it isn't such a big deal. Of what I received, the Oolong was the best. The Pu-erh was okay, though nothing special, and the Jasmine has a slight aftertaste, leading me to believe it was artificially flavored. Good Jasmine tea should be flavored by the scent of the flower, nothing else. The green and blacks were just okay.You could do worse if you were to buy teabags, but not much. I would recommend buying good loose leaf tea from dedicated tea vendors who are more upfront about what exactly they are selling you. At this price, you really can't expect to get quality tea. But if you are looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who doesn't know their tea, you could do worse. At least afterward you have some cute little tins in which to store future teas!

I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try.

I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products.  However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you.

The product has a sealed lid, not a \"pop-top lid\" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed.  See below for the correct information.  I have notified Amazon of this error.  Somehow 5 grams of protein have been \"lost\" from the can contents.I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one, get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can).  This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more.I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat.  This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use.  The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item.  The meat flakes into small pieces easily, so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it.  It would also make a good filling for enchiladas, tortillas or quesadillas.  I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product.  It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks.  For those who don't like tuna, it's a great alternative.Basically, it's chicken when you need it ready to go, and it is a good source of protein with very little fat.  One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories, 9 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV), 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?).  If sodium is a concern, consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer.It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long!  It's fresh when you need it.  I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some)Update:Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese.I haven't tried the concoction yet, but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product to have in your cupboard and a good price", "unixReviewTime": 1297382400, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011"}

This is a wonderfully flavorful soup. You get real clam taste and a good texture (little on the thin side but acceptable), and even a bit of creaminess. It is actually the best tasting store bought clam chowder from a national brand I have ever tried. I have tried various types of Campbells before and Progresso, and probably some regional brands I can't remember.But this is a very good soup. The first few ingridients in order are water, clam stock, potatoes, celery, clams, vegetable oil. Unfortunately Campell's does use high fructose corn syrup, but it is at least fairly far down the ingridient list. Too bad to save a few pennies or less (maybe even a fraction of a cent over real sugar?) probably per can of production they choose that. It does contain monosodium glutamate in case that is a no go for some people.Overall though this is great to have in your pantry. You get a good amount of fill for 150 calories but you are also getting 15% of DRA for Total Fat 10 grams, and 10% of saturated fat, 2 grams. Zero trans fat is listed. It is good enough to have for lunch a couple of times a week. Pair this with some fruit, and maybe some cheese and you will have a good enjoyable work lunch. Nice to have on hand for rainy days also.It takes 1 minute 15 seconds on high. It is a narrow can but you do have the option of putting the 'sip cap' back on and drinking your soup.

It only takes a minute and 15 seconds to heat up, so it is a quick and convenient meal. The container is compact enough that you can keep several cans in your desk so you can just grab one when you're ready for lunch. Being able to heat up the container means one less bowl to clean and it's easy enough to rinse out and recycle the can when you are through with it. The soup is filled with potatoes, celery, and clams and is delicious. It's not too salty, which can be a problem with canned soup.What I didn't like: the container. Yes, I love its convenience, but it's too tall. The soup is meant to be sipped, not eaten with a spoon, but you still have to stir it and when you use a spoon to do it, almost the entire spoon goes into the can, which is very messy. Also, the plastic lid on the can is hard to take off and the opening to sip the soup needs to be wider, since items like the potatoes and clams sometimes get stuck and you need to take the lid off to finish the soup - and it's very hard to use a spoon to eat the remainder because of the shape of the can.Nutritional Facts: Each container has one service size that is 160 calories (calories from fat are 90).

The texture is also a bit odd.The so-called cheese flavor was nonexistent, and the bacon flavor is very, very faint.  Even the potato flavor is really bland.The texture isn't a smooth puree like a typical &#34;cream of&#34; soup; it is filled with what resemble mashy bits of baked potato.  That doesn't ruin it, but I'd prefer the smooth style, or at the most have a little texture from some bacon bits.The product design is thus:  You have a nice, sturdy cup, with a somewhat non-spill red cap.  Shake the cup to mix; remove the red cap; peel off a foil seal; heat in the microwave for 1-2 minutes; let stand for 1 additional minute in the microwave; then replace red cap.Note that the cup retains a metal ring around the lip, which personally unnerves me as I don't like putting anything with metal on it into the microwave.  I assume that, if Campbell's markets it as microwaveable, then it must be okay.  I haven't had one spark or catch fire.  Yet.The cup does not get too hot to hold, and the red cap works well for drinking the soup, although I wouldn't rely on it in the non-spill department.  Note that the cup is filled to the very brim, which means you have to handle it carefully to avoid spilling during preparation.  There is no room to add any extras (like, something that will give it flavor).  You have to consume enough of the soup to create space if you want to add anything to it.On the plus side:  It's filling; doesn't taste very chemically; has only 130 calories; is easy to stash at work or wherever; and if you are dieting, you could have this, and possibly something like crudites, fruit, or a salad with it, and still stay under 200 calories for a meal, which is excellent on a diet.

The company redesigned it at some point and about a quarter of the time the container will fall over in the microwave. I've tried it in 3 different microwaves. My home one which is very old and has a spinning plate does OK, but the two on campus have both had huge spills happen.

It tips; it pops and eventually spills all over.  However, if you keep an eye on this product, stirring it every 20-30 seconds of the 2-3 minute heating period, you can avoid the spilling and tipping, ect.  Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.

It is well machined and manufactured in the U.S. but is simply a contoured chrome-plated mixing rod and a mason jar lid with a rubber seal. Highly recommended with the following caveats- Here are my suggestions and recommendations from a peanut butter aficionado:1. This company manufactures at least 6-7 different models geared to the lid size (in millimeters) of your particular brand of PB. Examine the inside of your lid for its size and select the appropriate model #.  Trader Joes PB accepts 70mm lids- Model 300[[ASIN:B003IQH72M Witmer Company Peanut Butter Mixer, Model 300].Remember...each manufacturer uses different sized lids so measure carefully before ordering. This information is not clearly identified for consumers.2. Replacement lids and plastic lid liners are available from [...] for $2.50 and $1.00 respectively plus S/H. I strongly recommend purchasing an extra set as these will wear and need replacement.3. Prepare and stir several jars of PB at a time to help extend the life of the lid and liners and save time.4. Avoid placing too much downward pressure on the lid when stirring-This may rupture the seal of the lid.5. Store the hand-washed mixer in a gallon sized Ziplock bag for future use.

To use the peanut butter just nuke in microwave  (without the lid of course) for about 30 seconds.- If you typically buy the larger peanut butter jars, go to Witmer's web site and order the larger stirrer.

This is the second time I've opened a shirataki noodle package expecting to be knocked back by a horrible smell, only to smell nothing but a mild odor reminiscent of some soy-based product.As for the noodles themselves, the texture didn't have that strange \"cartilage-like\" feel of fettucine-style Miracle Noodles. However, they were very rubbery and stretchy, requiring a lot of chewing. Personally, I found nothing offensive about this texture but those expecting it to have the consistency of spaghetti might find themselves disgusted or just plain disappointed by it, since these are being touted as a substitute for pasta.Flavor-wise, these noodles have none. This poses a huge problem for those hoping to turn to them to \"lose weight.\" This becomes all too apparent when you come across recipes from other users for this product. More often than not, the recipes often call for rich, fattening sauces; meats, fish, seafood; and other ingredients that usually bump up the calories a hundred-fold. (One recipe I saw-- kid you not-- involved fried pork sausage!}Why do recipes for shirataki noodles tend to go overboard? Well, since they have no flavor, you can't just boil them up as you would other noodles and eat them with a basic soup base or sauce. You have to literally drown them in tons of other stuff to make them filling. So whatever health benefits you gain by substituting carbs with these shirataki noodles is canceled out by the calories and sodium you wind up tacking on from the sauces and other junk you have to add to make them \"work.\"All in all, a \"so-so\" product-- not bad, not great. Adventurous chefs and eaters who like to try new things may get a kick out of them, because of the interesting texture and cooking challenge they pose. Dieters on the other hand may want to steer clear. Because these noodles have no taste, they'll find themselves needing to add so many ingredients that they may as well just be cooking a \"regular\" meal with these as nothing more than a side dish.

We've tried a variety of pasta and noodle alternatives (spaghetti squash etc) and the results ranged from interesting to...terrible. The spaghetti squash was the best alternative but it certainly didn't taste like regular pasta. But regular pasta plays havoc with our blood sugar and whole wheat pasta wasn't to our liking...so we continued our search.These Tofu Shirataki Fettucini are the absolute alternative to pasta which we've found and they are very tasty. I noticed that one person here said they were \"tough\" and \"inedible\". NOT TRUE. Also, they have only 40 calories per package and one package was certainly enough to be a generous serving for me (it might take two packages for someone with a hefty appetite). I tested my blood sugar before and after eating these, both within an hour of eating them and several hours later. My blood sugar stayed nice and level, so there was that benefit as well.As far as texture goes, they ARE closer to an \"al dente\" (a bit chewy) pasta than an overcooked, mushy pasta but we'd always preferred our pasta a bit on the \"al dente\" side. If you don't like \"chewy\" you might not like the Tofu Pasta. That didn't bother us one bit.True, the taste is not identical to pasta but we both felt that (like most tofu) it picked up the taste of whatever we put on it and any remaining taste was subtle, in our opinion.The first time we ate it we put on homemade tomato sauce, fresh Parmesan and oregano and basil (fresh basil) It was yummy! The second time we made spaghetti (canned sauce and ground beef and freshly chopped spices) and it was also delicious. I then experimented with various sauces, from those with a sour cream base to creamed cottage cheese and a bit of butter and green onions. Every time, the result was delicious - and what a calorie savings over regular pasta.We have not eaten them plain or buttered, like regular noodles or pasta. I have a feeling the texture might be more noticable then and there might be a subtle taste that would be different from pasta.This is as detailed and clear as I can be. We were absolutely DELIGHTED to discover and use these and found them to be the best substitute by far for our favorite pasta (although we're certainly open to suggestions for others).PS: Since writing my original review, I wanted to note that I adapted a sweet noodle kugel recipe using these as the \"noodles\". It was delicious. For anyone who might be interested in doing the same, I did NOT bake the kugel like you do a traditional one. I simply used Light Sour cream, cinnamon and Splenda to make a kugel that would work for diabetics or those on a diet.

It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as \"chewy\" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com.

Having read the reviews as well as being familiar with various Asian pastas, e.g., rice noodles, mung bean noodles, egg noodles, etc., I was neither put off nor surprised by descriptions of this product's texture/smell. I bought one each of this (which, surprisingly, I preferred) and the ramen-type and have tried both with Annie Chun's Thai Peanut Sauce (and now wish I'd had some chopped peanuts to add for texture).Actually, the oft-cited aroma didn't hit me until the 2.5 minute parboiling recommended on the package and yes, it was rather peculiar. But it disappeared quickly and the noodles had no aroma or particular flavor afterward. I suggest draining them very well and blotting them with a paper towel so that they're more receptive to absorbing the sauce of your choice. I don't think they're a good choice as a vehicle for Western-type sauces--their texture is very Asian and is complemented by Asian sauces. But hey, that's just me; other people who've reviewed them enjoy them with Western dressings. They pick up the flavor of sauces quite well, have a negligible calorie count (40 for the whole package), are low in carbs, and actually contain a bit of protein. I have no reason to think they wouldn't work equally well in stir-fries and soups. My only complaint is that at two bucks a pop for an appetizer-sized portion, they're expensive--discovering that the nutritional analysis was based on a two-serving package earned a derisive snort from yours truly. I checked Koreatown (same price) and found them in Chinatown for $1.45--still not cheap, but definitely easier to justify at 25+% cheaper than two bucks.Not for everyone, but really yummy for those who like Asian food or are receptive to trying something new.

The other brands are more rubbery, this one really has the exact texture of ramen, just don't let other bad reviews mess with your head, it's really not bad at all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is not pasta, it's more like undigestable ramen and it's good!", "unixReviewTime": 1340236800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2012"}

I think some people are either rinsing or boiling, but you need to do both. If you just dump the noodles into boiling water, you stick the flavor of the nasty preservative water into them permanently. Dump the noodles into a colander and thoroughly rinse them. THEN bring water to a boil, dump in the noodles, boil for 2-3 minutes, drain and rinse the noodles. Then they're ready. Yeah it's labor intensive, but the noodles also have so few calories, it's worth it.Do not try to pour marinara sauce over these, you will be severely disappointed. These are asian type noodles. It would be like putting rice noodles in your mac n cheese. Just don't do it. Stick to Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, etc... flavors and you will be much happier.One of my favorite dishes to make is to saute some onions and garlic in a little oil, add about 1/4 cup of chicken broth (just enough to cover the noodles) and a tablespoon of curry paste. Then once those are all cooked, add some sliced hard-boiled egg to it. Makes a great and very filling lunch. Much more filling than lean cuisine!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Yummy in ASIAN DISHES", "unixReviewTime": 1357862400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2013"}

Unfortunately, they are just a little too unusual for my taste. They're not awful, but the texture is very slippery and chewy. As was mentioned in other reviews, even after rinsing and soaking they still have a distinctive smell and taste. A sesame-soy based sauce seems to compliment the shirataki noodles best. (i.e., masks the taste) Spaghetti sauce just doesn't taste right with it.
